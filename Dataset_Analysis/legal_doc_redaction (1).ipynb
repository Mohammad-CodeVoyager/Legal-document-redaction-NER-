The Turkish Government (\\u201cthe Government\\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\\n\\nOn 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \\u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 \\u00a7 1).\\n\\nOn 13 January 2005 the Court joined the applications. It further decided to declare the applications partly inadmissible and to communicate the complaints concerning the lack of prompt and detailed information on the nature and cause of the accusations, and the non-communication to the applicants of the submissions of the Principal Public Prosecutor to the Court of Cassation. Under Article 29 \\u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.\\n\\nThe applicants and the Government each filed observations on the admissibility and merits (Rule 59 \\u00a7 1).\\n\\nTHE FACTS\\n\\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\\n\\nThe applicants were born in 1973, 1975, and 1980 respectively. They were detained in Elaz\\u0131\\u011f Prison in Turkey.\\n\\nOn 14 March 1999 the police raided a flat which was used as a cell by Hezbollah in Mardin. The police officers seized, among other things, three computer hard disks during the operation. The applicants' names were recorded on these hard disks as members of Hezbollah.\\n\\nOn 4 June 1999 the applicants were arrested by police officers from the anti-terror branch of the Diyarbak\\u0131r Security Directorate on suspicion of being members of Hezbollah. On the same day, the police officers drafted arrest protocols stating that the applicants had been arrested in the course of an operation conducted against the members of the illegal organisation.\\n\\nOn 5 June 1999 the public prosecutor of the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court drew up a list of the materials that were seized during the raid in Mardin in order to place them in the custody of the court, amongst which the computer hard disks were noted.\\n\\nOn 11 June 1999 the applicants gave statements to the police where they accepted the charges against them. On the same day, they were brought before the public prosecutor, and thereafter before the investigating judge of the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court, where they denied both the accuracy of the statements taken by the police and all the charges against them. The investigating judge ordered that the applicants be detained on remand.\\n\\nOn 25 June 1999 the public prosecutor filed an indictment with the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court, accusing the applicants of being members of Hezbollah pursuant to Article 168 \\u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code.\\n\\nAt the hearings before the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court the applicants denied the content of their police statements alleging that they were taken under duress. The court read out the police statements that were taken from M.\\u00c7., M.P. and A.Y. \\u2013 who were also accused of being members of the same organisation \\u2013 to the applicants and asked the latter to comment on them. The applicants stated that they did not know these persons, and that they did not accept the parts of the statements that were against them. The court further read out the transcriptions of the hard disks to the applicants and asked them about their counter-arguments against these. They denied the content of these documents. They further stated that they had no idea as to how their names had appeared on the computer hard disks.\\n\\nOn 27 December 2001 the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court noted that the applicants' police statements were supported by information gathered from the archive of the organisation and further evidence. It accordingly convicted the applicants of the offence as charged and sentenced them to twelve years and six months' imprisonment. The applicants appealed.\\n\\nThe Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation in his written submissions recommended that the court uphold the decision of the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court.\\n\\nOn 27 May 2002 the Court of Cassation, having regard, inter alia, to the opinion of the Principal Prosecutor, upheld the judgment of the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court.\",\n          \"PROCEDURE\\n\\nThe case originated in an application (no. 40378/10) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\\u201cthe Convention\\u201d) by a British national, Ms Fazia Ali (\\u201cthe applicant\\u201d), on 15 July 2010.\\n\\nThe applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Birmingham. She is represented before the Court by Mr M. McIlvaney of the Community Law Partnership, a solicitor practising in Birmingham.\\n\\nThe United Kingdom Government (\\u201cthe Government\\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms R. Tomlinson of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\\n\\nOn 7 November 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.\\n\\nTHE FACTS\\n\\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\\n\\nThe applicant, a parent of two young children, is a homeless person in priority need of accommodation within the meaning of Part VII of the Housing Act 1996 (\\u201cthe 1996 Act\\u201d).\\n\\nBirmingham City Council (\\u201cthe Council\\u201d) is a local housing authority within the meaning of the 1996 Act and is required, under Part VII of that Act, to perform statutory functions in relation to homeless persons in its area.\\n\\nThe applicant applied as a homeless person to Birmingham City Council for assistance in October 2006. By letter dated 7 November 2006 the Council determined that the applicant was homeless, eligible for assistance, in priority need and not intentionally homeless. The authority therefore accepted that it owed the applicant the \\u201cmain housing duty\\u201d to provide accommodation to her and her family. On 8 November 2006 the authority made the applicant an offer of accommodation which she refused because she was unhappy with the location. The authority told the applicant that in its view the accommodation was suitable but following a review of that decision, which was determined in the applicant\\u2019s favour, they agreed to make her another offer.\\n\\nOn 14 March 2007 a Housing Officer informed the applicant by telephone that another offer was being made, that a viewing had been arranged and that a letter would follow. The authority claims that on that same day a written offer of accommodation at 16 Bromford Lane, Birmingham was sent to the applicant. That letter contained a statement to the effect that if the applicant refused the offer without good cause the authority would consider that it had discharged its duty to her under Part VII of the 1996 Act. However, the applicant denied receiving the letter; instead, she claimed that she had to telephone the housing office to obtain the address and arrange the viewing appointment. She viewed the property on 19 March 2007 but declined the offer as she was not happy with the condition of the communal area.\\n\\nBy letter dated 21 March 2007 the Council notified the applicant that, by reason of her rejection of its offer, pursuant to section 193 of the Housing Act its duty to her under Part VII of the 1996 Act had been discharged. By letter dated 29 March 2007 the applicant notified the Council that she had not received an offer in writing and requested that the Council review its decision.\\n\\nWhile the applicant\\u2019s case was pending before the review panel, a further offer of accommodation was made to her pursuant to a different scheme, namely the scheme for the provision of housing accommodation under Part VI of the 1996 Act. She did not accept this offer.\\n\\nOn 1 May 2007 a Homelessness Review Officer employed by the Council conducted a telephone interview with the applicant to establish her reasons for refusing the offer of accommodation at 16 Bromford Lane. The Officer claimed that in the course of this conversation the applicant accepted that she had in fact received the offer letter but refused the offer of accommodation because there was no lift and the entrance to the property was dirty, which could put her youngest son\\u2019s health at risk. However, the applicant claims that at the time she had thought she was being questioned about the subsequent offer of accommodation, in respect of which she did not deny having received a letter.\\n\\nBy letter dated 2 May 2007 the Homelessness Review Officer upheld the decision that the applicant\\u2019s refusal of the offer of accommodation had discharged the Council\\u2019s main housing duty to her under section 193(2) of the 1996 Act. In particular, the Officer found that the applicant had been sent an offer letter from the Council which complied with the mandatory requirements of section 193 of the 1996 Act prior to her refusal and there was no reason to believe that she had not received it. In any case, she noted that the applicant had not refused the accommodation because she had not received a written offer but because she did not consider the accommodation to be suitable for her family\\u2019s needs.\\n\\nThe applicant appealed to Birmingham County Court under section 204 of the 1996 Act, which allowed for an appeal on a point of law only. The jurisdiction exercised by the County Court under section 204 was that of judicial review. In her grounds of appeal the applicant claimed that the Council, in reaching its decision, had taken into account irrelevant considerations and/or acted under a fundamental mistake of fact; that the Council had acted unlawfully as it had failed to make adequate inquiries to enable it to reach a lawful decision; that its decision was one which no rational Council would have made; that it had fettered its discretion; and that it had acted in breach of natural justice.\\n\\nThe appeal was heard on 29 August 2007, on which date the judge noted that the only ground of appeal argued before him was that the letter of offer had failed to arrive. The applicant submitted that the County Court should hear evidence on the matter so that it could determine it for itself. However, although the judge accepted that the Homelessness Review Officer was not an independent or impartial tribunal, he found that the decision whether or not the letter had been received was properly and fairly to be made by her and he declined to hear evidence on the point. Although it was not specifically stated in the correspondence between the Council and the applicant, the judge appeared to consider whether or not the Council had discharged its duty under section 193(7) (see paragraph 25 below).\\n\\nThe applicant subsequently appealed to the Court of Appeal and then to the Supreme Court. At each level, the grounds of appeal were that the decision taken by the Council\\u2019s Homelessness Review Officer had constituted a determination of the applicant\\u2019s civil rights for the purposes of Article 6 \\u00a7 1 of the Convention; that the Officer had not been an independent or impartial tribunal as required by Article 6 \\u00a7 1; that the decision of the Officer had turned on the resolution of a simple question of disputed primary fact, involving no application of specialist knowledge; that pursuant to Tsfayo v. the United Kingdom, no. 60860/00, 14 November 2006, Article 6 \\u00a7 1 required that the applicant be able to appeal that simple factual determination; and, alternatively, that the restriction of all statutory appeals to points of law, no matter what the nature of the decision, was incompatible with Article 6 \\u00a7 1.\\n\\nBoth the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court decision on the applicant\\u2019s appeal followed the decision of the House of Lords in Runa Begum v. London Borough of Tower Hamlets [2003] UKHL 5. In Runa Begum the House of Lords found that judicial review of a Homelessness Review Officer\\u2019s decision that a claimant had been unreasonable in rejecting the accommodation offered to her provided \\u201csufficiency of review\\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 \\u00a7 1. The House of Lords stressed that although the Officer had been called upon to resolve some disputed factual issues, these findings of fact were \\u201conly staging posts on the way to the much broader judgments\\u201d concerning local conditions and the availability of alternative accommodation, which the Officer had the specialist knowledge and experience to make. Although the Officer could not be regarded as independent, since she was employed by the Council which had made the offer of accommodation which the claimant had rejected, statutory regulations provided substantial safeguards to ensure that the review would be independently and fairly conducted, free from improper external influences. Any significant departure from the procedural rules would have afforded a ground of appeal.\\n\\nThe applicant submitted that the present case could be distinguished from that of Runa Begum because it concerned the simple question of a finding of primary fact rather than an evaluative judgment, such as a qualitative assessment of \\u201csuitability\\u201d.\\n\\nA. The judgment of the Court of Appeal\\n\\nOn 7 November 2008 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\\u2019s appeal. In doing so, it proceeded on the assumption that the case involved the determination of the applicant\\u2019s civil rights for the purposes of Article 6 \\u00a7 1 of the Convention. In relation to the question whether the decision of the Homelessness Review Officer had turned on the resolution of a simple question of primary fact, or whether it required the application of specialist knowledge, Thomas LJ stated that: \\u201ci) It is far from easy to draw the distinction advanced in practice. A finding of suitability is itself a finding based on conclusions of primary fact ... ii) There would be considerable complexity in administering a scheme with these distinctions. A scheme which enabled certain factual issues to be subject to a full right of appeal and others which would not be so subject would be too uncertain and too complex ... iii) ... [I]f the extent of the review by the court was determined by the answer to the questions of whether a finding of fact was a primary finding, or whether that finding required expertise or whether that finding was determinative, the room for argument and uncertainty would be considerable ... .... v) The additional review which would be provided by the suggested full right of appeal on fact would not in practice be very wide ... vi) The full right of appeal sought from a review officer on fact might have to be significantly different from an appeal from a court ... the procedure adopted by the reviewing officer in reaching findings of fact is informal and there are no transcripts of evidence. .... viii) There would therefore clearly be significant implications for not only the statutory scheme but for the court and tribunal system, if this court were to hold that a full right of appeal was required on findings of primary fact or on issues of primary fact where the finding was determinative ... The statutory scheme for housing and the statutory scheme for the method of appeals in respect of courts and tribunals are determined by Parliament; funds are provided for their finance by Parliament ... ix) The present scope of the appeal provides a real measure of protection for homeless appellants. It is clear from the careful judgments of Judge MacDuff QC and Judge McKenna that both considered that the housing authority had fairly treated both appellants in cases where the determinative issue was a question of fact. This conclusion reinforces the view I have expressed that the review by the County Court in cases of this kind was sufficient and that there is no reason to attempt to find that it is outside the scope of the decision in Runa Begum. It demonstrates, as Lord Bingham observed at paragraph 11, that the scheme properly operated should ensure fair treatment. I consider that it does whether the decision turns on a simple issue of primary fact or a conclusion of fact based on primary facts (such as a conclusion on suitability).\\u201d\\n\\nThomas LJ therefore concluded that the decision of the House of Lords in Runa Begum applied to all County Court appeals under section 204 of the 1996 Act, no matter whether the decision turned on a simple issue of primary fact or not. He further held that the decision in Tsfayo, which concerned the housing benefit scheme, did not affect appeals brought in homelessness cases: \\u201c34. ... In the first place the Strasbourg Court relied on the decision in Runa Begum in reaching its conclusion and said nothing that cast doubt on the correctness of the decision. Secondly, the decisions in Runa Begum and Tsfayo each turned on a careful examination of the whole of the statutory scheme relevant to the particular case. Thirdly, it is apparent from the details of the scheme considered in Tsfayo that whereas in the case of prospective benefit, central government reimbursed the local authority 95% of what it was required to pay, it only reimbursed 50% of backdated awards (see paragraph 19 of the decision); this fact had been heavily relied upon in argument (see paragraph 37 of the decision) for the powerful contention that the hearing had taken place before a tribunal consisting of members of an authority which would be required to pay 50% of the benefit if it made an award in the applicant\\u2019s favour; the HBRB was not independent of the parties. Finally when the housing benefits scheme was looked upon as a whole, it was readily apparent that a conclusion could be reached, in contradistinction to the scheme under Part VII of the Housing Act, that the particular scheme was not compliant with Article 6.1.\\u201d\\n\\nB. The judgment of the Supreme Court\\n\\nOn 17 February 2010 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\\u2019s appeal, finding that the determination by the Council, that its duty to secure accommodation for the applicant had ceased, was not a determination of her civil rights within the meaning of Article 6. Lord Hope of Craighead with whom Baroness Hale and Lord Brown agreed, stated that: \\u201c... I would be prepared now to hold that cases where the award of services or benefits in kind is not an individual right of which the applicant can consider himself the holder, but is dependent upon a series of evaluative judgments by the provider as to whether the statutory criteria are satisfied and how the need for it ought to be met, do not engage article 6(1). In my opinion they do not give rise to \\u2018civil rights\\u2019 within the autonomous meaning that is given to that expression for the purposes of that article.\\u201d\\n\\nIn supporting that conclusion Lord Hope looked to what the relevant provisions within Part VII of the 1996 Act were intended to achieve. He observed that: \\u201c... It provides a right to assistance if the relevant conditions are satisfied. But this is not a pecuniary right, nor is the benefit that is to be provided defined by the application of specific rules laid down by the statute. Even where the full homelessness duty arises under section 193, the content of the statutory duty lacks precise definition. There is no private law analogy. The duty is expressed in broad terms \\u2013 to secure that \\u2018accommodation is available\\u2019 \\u2013 which leaves much to the discretionary administrative judgment of the authority.\\u201d\\n\\nHe continued, following a review of the jurisprudence of the Court, by noting that: \\u201c43. There are however ... a number of straws in the wind since Runa Begum that suggest that a distinction can indeed be made between the class of social security and welfare benefits that are of the kind exemplified by Salesi v Italy whose substance the domestic law defines precisely and those benefits which are, in their essence, dependent upon the exercise of judgment by the relevant authority ...\\u201d\\n\\nLater in his judgment, Lord Hope, for completeness, set out some observations on whether the scheme of decision-making was Article 6\\u2011compliant. He commented that the possibility, foreshadowed in argument, of separating simple, formal questions of \\u201cgateway\\u201d facts, such as the letter issue, from the expert assessment of suitability would needlessly complicate a scheme which was designed to be simple to administer.\\n\\nThe court went on to observe that the fact that a County Court did not have a full fact-finding jurisdiction when hearing an appeal under section 204 of the 1996 Act did not mean that the applicant was deprived of what was required to satisfy the guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention. In this connection, Lord Hope said this: \\u201c54. ... For ease of administration the review is entrusted to a single officer who is equipped to deal with issues as to the suitability of the accommodation that has been declined. An answer to the question whether or not the letters were received was incidental to a more searching and judgmental inquiry into the accommodation\\u2019s suitability. ... These cases are quite different from Tsfayo, where no broad questions requiring professional knowledge or experience had to be addressed once the question whether there was good cause had been answered. In these circumstances I would hold that the ratio of the decision in Runa Begum should be applied and that the absence of a full fact-finding jurisdiction in the court to which an appeal lies under section 204 does not deprive it of what it needs to satisfy the requirements of article 6(1).\\u201d\\n\\nUnlike the County Court, the Supreme Court appeared to consider whether or not the Council had discharged its duty to the applicant under section 193(5); however, it appeared to accept that a formal letter of offer was required by that subsection.\",\n          \"PROCEDURE\\n\\nThe case originated in an application (no. 41656/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\\u201cthe Convention\\u201d) by two Polish nationals, Mr Adam Mazgaj and his son, Mr Grzegorz Mazgaj (\\u201cthe applicants\\u201d), on 8 June 2001.\\n\\nThe applicants were represented by Mr S. Kotu\\u0142a, a lawyer practising in Lublin. The Polish Government (\\u201cthe Government\\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\\u0142\\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\\n\\nOn 25 May 2009 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \\u00a7 3 of the Convention).\\n\\nOn 24 September 2009 the Government requested the Court to sever the complaints of the applicants.\\n\\nOn 22 October 2009 the Court granted the Government's request and decided to sever the complaints of Adam Mazgaj (\\u201cthe applicant\\u201d) from the rest of the application.\\n\\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the restrictions placed on his contacts with his close family members when he was detained amounted to a violation of his right to respect for family life under Article 8 of the Convention.\\n\\nTHE FACTS\\n\\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\\n\\nThe applicant was born in 1928 and lives in W\\u0142odawa.\\n\\nA. The applicant's arrest and detention\\n\\nOn 28 June 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w District Court remanded the applicant in custody for two months. The court relied on a statement given on 27 June 2000 by the applicant's mentally ill son, G.M., who accused the applicant of homicide. The court also referred to the likelihood that a heavy penalty would be imposed on the applicant.\\n\\nOn an unspecified date the applicant appealed and requested that the preventive measure imposed on him be reduced in severity. He relied on his age (he was seventy-two years old at the time) and on the fact that he was undergoing medical treatment.\\n\\nOn 12 July 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court, relying on the same grounds as the District Court, upheld the challenged decision.\\n\\nOn 23 August 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor requested the court to extend the applicant's detention.\\n\\nOn 25 August 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w District Court granted the request and extended the applicant's detention for another month, until 28 September 2000.\\n\\nOn an unspecified date the applicant's lawyer appealed against that decision.\\n\\nOn 12 September 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court upheld the challenged decision. The court recognised that the only evidence against the applicant was the statement by the applicant's son, who had undergone a psychiatric examination. It stressed, however, that according to the results of the psychiatric report, the applicant's son's mental condition had improved. The court also relied on the risk that the applicant could obstruct the proceedings.\\n\\nThe Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court, relying on the same grounds as previously, extended the applicant's detention on 22 September 2000 for three months, and then, on 22 December 2000 for a further three months.\\n\\nThe applicant and his lawyer appealed against the latter decision.\\n\\nOn 18 January 2001 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Court of Appeal gave a decision and released the applicant. The court referred to a psychiatric opinion of 2 January 2001 concerning the applicant's son and found that his statements could not be considered reliable evidence.\\n\\nB. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\\n\\nOn 20 December 2001 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court gave judgment and acquitted the applicant.\\n\\nOn an unspecified date the Regional Rzesz\\u00f3w Prosecutor appealed against that judgment.\\n\\nOn 9 May 2002 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Court of Appeal upheld the first\\u2011instance judgment.\\n\\nC. Proceedings for compensation for manifestly unjustified detention of the applicant\\n\\nOn an unspecified date the applicant lodged a claim for compensation for manifestly unjustified detention with the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court.\\n\\nOn an unspecified date the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court gave judgment, against which the applicant appealed.\\n\\nOn 22 December 2004 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Court of Appeal remitted the case.\\n\\nOn 29 June 2005 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court granted the applicant compensation in the amount of 10,360 Polish zlotys (PLN).\\n\\nThe applicant appealed against that judgment, arguing that the instructions given by the Court of Appeal, which had remitted the case, had not been followed.\\n\\nOn 22 September 2005 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Court of Appeal granted the appeal in part, amended the first-instance judgment and increased the compensation to PLN 10,809. The court considered that the compensation should also include the travelling costs borne by the applicant's family to visit him in prison.\\n\\nD. Restrictions placed on the applicant's contact with his family\\n\\nOn 10 July 2000 J.M., the applicant's wife, and R.M., the applicant's second son, asked the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor for permission to see the applicant. They also requested information on the applicant's state of health.\\n\\nAccording to the applicant's submissions the prosecutor did not reply to their request.\\n\\nOn 3 August 2000 the applicant's lawyer requested the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor to allow him to see his wife and son. He relied on the applicant's age and state of health.\\n\\nOn 17 August 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor refused to allow the applicant personal contact with his family. The refusal was motivated by the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation (z uwagi na dobro tocz\\u0105cego si\\u0119 \\u015bledztwa).\\n\\nOn 21 September 2000 J.M. and R.M. again requested the prosecutor to allow them to visit the applicant.

The Turkish Government (\\u201cthe Government\\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\\n\\nOn 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \\u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 \\u00a7 1).\\n\\nOn 13 January 2005 the Court joined the applications. It further decided to declare the applications partly inadmissible and to communicate the complaints concerning the lack of prompt and detailed information on the nature and cause of the accusations, and the non-communication to the applicants of the submissions of the Principal Public Prosecutor to the Court of Cassation. Under Article 29 \\u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.\\n\\nThe applicants and the Government each filed observations on the admissibility and merits (Rule 59 \\u00a7 1).\\n\\nTHE FACTS\\n\\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\\n\\nThe applicants were born in 1973, 1975, and 1980 respectively. They were detained in Elaz\\u0131\\u011f Prison in Turkey.\\n\\nOn 14 March 1999 the police raided a flat which was used as a cell by Hezbollah in Mardin. The police officers seized, among other things, three computer hard disks during the operation. The applicants' names were recorded on these hard disks as members of Hezbollah.\\n\\nOn 4 June 1999 the applicants were arrested by police officers from the anti-terror branch of the Diyarbak\\u0131r Security Directorate on suspicion of being members of Hezbollah. On the same day, the police officers drafted arrest protocols stating that the applicants had been arrested in the course of an operation conducted against the members of the illegal organisation.\\n\\nOn 5 June 1999 the public prosecutor of the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court drew up a list of the materials that were seized during the raid in Mardin in order to place them in the custody of the court, amongst which the computer hard disks were noted.\\n\\nOn 11 June 1999 the applicants gave statements to the police where they accepted the charges against them. On the same day, they were brought before the public prosecutor, and thereafter before the investigating judge of the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court, where they denied both the accuracy of the statements taken by the police and all the charges against them. The investigating judge ordered that the applicants be detained on remand.\\n\\nOn 25 June 1999 the public prosecutor filed an indictment with the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court, accusing the applicants of being members of Hezbollah pursuant to Article 168 \\u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code.\\n\\nAt the hearings before the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court the applicants denied the content of their police statements alleging that they were taken under duress. The court read out the police statements that were taken from M.\\u00c7., M.P. and A.Y. \\u2013 who were also accused of being members of the same organisation \\u2013 to the applicants and asked the latter to comment on them. The applicants stated that they did not know these persons, and that they did not accept the parts of the statements that were against them. The court further read out the transcriptions of the hard disks to the applicants and asked them about their counter-arguments against these. They denied the content of these documents. They further stated that they had no idea as to how their names had appeared on the computer hard disks.\\n\\nOn 27 December 2001 the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court noted that the applicants' police statements were supported by information gathered from the archive of the organisation and further evidence. It accordingly convicted the applicants of the offence as charged and sentenced them to twelve years and six months' imprisonment. The applicants appealed.\\n\\nThe Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation in his written submissions recommended that the court uphold the decision of the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court.\\n\\nOn 27 May 2002 the Court of Cassation, having regard, inter alia, to the opinion of the Principal Prosecutor, upheld the judgment of the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court.\",\n          \"PROCEDURE\\n\\nThe case originated in an application (no. 40378/10) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\\u201cthe Convention\\u201d) by a British national, Ms Fazia Ali (\\u201cthe applicant\\u201d), on 15 July 2010.\\n\\nThe applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Birmingham. She is represented before the Court by Mr M. McIlvaney of the Community Law Partnership, a solicitor practising in Birmingham.\\n\\nThe United Kingdom Government (\\u201cthe Government\\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms R. Tomlinson of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\\n\\nOn 7 November 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.\\n\\nTHE FACTS\\n\\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\\n\\nThe applicant, a parent of two young children, is a homeless person in priority need of accommodation within the meaning of Part VII of the Housing Act 1996 (\\u201cthe 1996 Act\\u201d).\\n\\nBirmingham City Council (\\u201cthe Council\\u201d) is a local housing authority within the meaning of the 1996 Act and is required, under Part VII of that Act, to perform statutory functions in relation to homeless persons in its area.\\n\\nThe applicant applied as a homeless person to Birmingham City Council for assistance in October 2006. By letter dated 7 November 2006 the Council determined that the applicant was homeless, eligible for assistance, in priority need and not intentionally homeless. The authority therefore accepted that it owed the applicant the \\u201cmain housing duty\\u201d to provide accommodation to her and her family. On 8 November 2006 the authority made the applicant an offer of accommodation which she refused because she was unhappy with the location. The authority told the applicant that in its view the accommodation was suitable but following a review of that decision, which was determined in the applicant\\u2019s favour, they agreed to make her another offer.\\n\\nOn 14 March 2007 a Housing Officer informed the applicant by telephone that another offer was being made, that a viewing had been arranged and that a letter would follow. The authority claims that on that same day a written offer of accommodation at 16 Bromford Lane, Birmingham was sent to the applicant. That letter contained a statement to the effect that if the applicant refused the offer without good cause the authority would consider that it had discharged its duty to her under Part VII of the 1996 Act. However, the applicant denied receiving the letter; instead, she claimed that she had to telephone the housing office to obtain the address and arrange the viewing appointment. She viewed the property on 19 March 2007 but declined the offer as she was not happy with the condition of the communal area.\\n\\nBy letter dated 21 March 2007 the Council notified the applicant that, by reason of her rejection of its offer, pursuant to section 193 of the Housing Act its duty to her under Part VII of the 1996 Act had been discharged. By letter dated 29 March 2007 the applicant notified the Council that she had not received an offer in writing and requested that the Council review its decision.\\n\\nWhile the applicant\\u2019s case was pending before the review panel, a further offer of accommodation was made to her pursuant to a different scheme, namely the scheme for the provision of housing accommodation under Part VI of the 1996 Act. She did not accept this offer.\\n\\nOn 1 May 2007 a Homelessness Review Officer employed by the Council conducted a telephone interview with the applicant to establish her reasons for refusing the offer of accommodation at 16 Bromford Lane. The Officer claimed that in the course of this conversation the applicant accepted that she had in fact received the offer letter but refused the offer of accommodation because there was no lift and the entrance to the property was dirty, which could put her youngest son\\u2019s health at risk. However, the applicant claims that at the time she had thought she was being questioned about the subsequent offer of accommodation, in respect of which she did not deny having received a letter.\\n\\nBy letter dated 2 May 2007 the Homelessness Review Officer upheld the decision that the applicant\\u2019s refusal of the offer of accommodation had discharged the Council\\u2019s main housing duty to her under section 193(2) of the 1996 Act. In particular, the Officer found that the applicant had been sent an offer letter from the Council which complied with the mandatory requirements of section 193 of the 1996 Act prior to her refusal and there was no reason to believe that she had not received it. In any case, she noted that the applicant had not refused the accommodation because she had not received a written offer but because she did not consider the accommodation to be suitable for her family\\u2019s needs.\\n\\nThe applicant appealed to Birmingham County Court under section 204 of the 1996 Act, which allowed for an appeal on a point of law only. The jurisdiction exercised by the County Court under section 204 was that of judicial review. In her grounds of appeal the applicant claimed that the Council, in reaching its decision, had taken into account irrelevant considerations and/or acted under a fundamental mistake of fact; that the Council had acted unlawfully as it had failed to make adequate inquiries to enable it to reach a lawful decision; that its decision was one which no rational Council would have made; that it had fettered its discretion; and that it had acted in breach of natural justice.\\n\\nThe appeal was heard on 29 August 2007, on which date the judge noted that the only ground of appeal argued before him was that the letter of offer had failed to arrive. The applicant submitted that the County Court should hear evidence on the matter so that it could determine it for itself. However, although the judge accepted that the Homelessness Review Officer was not an independent or impartial tribunal, he found that the decision whether or not the letter had been received was properly and fairly to be made by her and he declined to hear evidence on the point. Although it was not specifically stated in the correspondence between the Council and the applicant, the judge appeared to consider whether or not the Council had discharged its duty under section 193(7) (see paragraph 25 below).\\n\\nThe applicant subsequently appealed to the Court of Appeal and then to the Supreme Court. At each level, the grounds of appeal were that the decision taken by the Council\\u2019s Homelessness Review Officer had constituted a determination of the applicant\\u2019s civil rights for the purposes of Article 6 \\u00a7 1 of the Convention; that the Officer had not been an independent or impartial tribunal as required by Article 6 \\u00a7 1; that the decision of the Officer had turned on the resolution of a simple question of disputed primary fact, involving no application of specialist knowledge; that pursuant to Tsfayo v. the United Kingdom, no. 60860/00, 14 November 2006, Article 6 \\u00a7 1 required that the applicant be able to appeal that simple factual determination; and, alternatively, that the restriction of all statutory appeals to points of law, no matter what the nature of the decision, was incompatible with Article 6 \\u00a7 1.\\n\\nBoth the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court decision on the applicant\\u2019s appeal followed the decision of the House of Lords in Runa Begum v. London Borough of Tower Hamlets [2003] UKHL 5. In Runa Begum the House of Lords found that judicial review of a Homelessness Review Officer\\u2019s decision that a claimant had been unreasonable in rejecting the accommodation offered to her provided \\u201csufficiency of review\\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 \\u00a7 1. The House of Lords stressed that although the Officer had been called upon to resolve some disputed factual issues, these findings of fact were \\u201conly staging posts on the way to the much broader judgments\\u201d concerning local conditions and the availability of alternative accommodation, which the Officer had the specialist knowledge and experience to make. Although the Officer could not be regarded as independent, since she was employed by the Council which had made the offer of accommodation which the claimant had rejected, statutory regulations provided substantial safeguards to ensure that the review would be independently and fairly conducted, free from improper external influences. Any significant departure from the procedural rules would have afforded a ground of appeal.\\n\\nThe applicant submitted that the present case could be distinguished from that of Runa Begum because it concerned the simple question of a finding of primary fact rather than an evaluative judgment, such as a qualitative assessment of \\u201csuitability\\u201d.\\n\\nA. The judgment of the Court of Appeal\\n\\nOn 7 November 2008 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\\u2019s appeal. In doing so, it proceeded on the assumption that the case involved the determination of the applicant\\u2019s civil rights for the purposes of Article 6 \\u00a7 1 of the Convention. In relation to the question whether the decision of the Homelessness Review Officer had turned on the resolution of a simple question of primary fact, or whether it required the application of specialist knowledge, Thomas LJ stated that: \\u201ci) It is far from easy to draw the distinction advanced in practice. A finding of suitability is itself a finding based on conclusions of primary fact ... ii) There would be considerable complexity in administering a scheme with these distinctions. A scheme which enabled certain factual issues to be subject to a full right of appeal and others which would not be so subject would be too uncertain and too complex ... iii) ... [I]f the extent of the review by the court was determined by the answer to the questions of whether a finding of fact was a primary finding, or whether that finding required expertise or whether that finding was determinative, the room for argument and uncertainty would be considerable ... .... v) The additional review which would be provided by the suggested full right of appeal on fact would not in practice be very wide ... vi) The full right of appeal sought from a review officer on fact might have to be significantly different from an appeal from a court ... the procedure adopted by the reviewing officer in reaching findings of fact is informal and there are no transcripts of evidence. .... viii) There would therefore clearly be significant implications for not only the statutory scheme but for the court and tribunal system, if this court were to hold that a full right of appeal was required on findings of primary fact or on issues of primary fact where the finding was determinative ... The statutory scheme for housing and the statutory scheme for the method of appeals in respect of courts and tribunals are determined by Parliament; funds are provided for their finance by Parliament ... ix) The present scope of the appeal provides a real measure of protection for homeless appellants. It is clear from the careful judgments of Judge MacDuff QC and Judge McKenna that both considered that the housing authority had fairly treated both appellants in cases where the determinative issue was a question of fact. This conclusion reinforces the view I have expressed that the review by the County Court in cases of this kind was sufficient and that there is no reason to attempt to find that it is outside the scope of the decision in Runa Begum. It demonstrates, as Lord Bingham observed at paragraph 11, that the scheme properly operated should ensure fair treatment. I consider that it does whether the decision turns on a simple issue of primary fact or a conclusion of fact based on primary facts (such as a conclusion on suitability).\\u201d\\n\\nThomas LJ therefore concluded that the decision of the House of Lords in Runa Begum applied to all County Court appeals under section 204 of the 1996 Act, no matter whether the decision turned on a simple issue of primary fact or not. He further held that the decision in Tsfayo, which concerned the housing benefit scheme, did not affect appeals brought in homelessness cases: \\u201c34. ... In the first place the Strasbourg Court relied on the decision in Runa Begum in reaching its conclusion and said nothing that cast doubt on the correctness of the decision. Secondly, the decisions in Runa Begum and Tsfayo each turned on a careful examination of the whole of the statutory scheme relevant to the particular case. Thirdly, it is apparent from the details of the scheme considered in Tsfayo that whereas in the case of prospective benefit, central government reimbursed the local authority 95% of what it was required to pay, it only reimbursed 50% of backdated awards (see paragraph 19 of the decision); this fact had been heavily relied upon in argument (see paragraph 37 of the decision) for the powerful contention that the hearing had taken place before a tribunal consisting of members of an authority which would be required to pay 50% of the benefit if it made an award in the applicant\\u2019s favour; the HBRB was not independent of the parties. Finally when the housing benefits scheme was looked upon as a whole, it was readily apparent that a conclusion could be reached, in contradistinction to the scheme under Part VII of the Housing Act, that the particular scheme was not compliant with Article 6.1.\\u201d\\n\\nB. The judgment of the Supreme Court\\n\\nOn 17 February 2010 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\\u2019s appeal, finding that the determination by the Council, that its duty to secure accommodation for the applicant had ceased, was not a determination of her civil rights within the meaning of Article 6. Lord Hope of Craighead with whom Baroness Hale and Lord Brown agreed, stated that: \\u201c... I would be prepared now to hold that cases where the award of services or benefits in kind is not an individual right of which the applicant can consider himself the holder, but is dependent upon a series of evaluative judgments by the provider as to whether the statutory criteria are satisfied and how the need for it ought to be met, do not engage article 6(1). In my opinion they do not give rise to \\u2018civil rights\\u2019 within the autonomous meaning that is given to that expression for the purposes of that article.\\u201d\\n\\nIn supporting that conclusion Lord Hope looked to what the relevant provisions within Part VII of the 1996 Act were intended to achieve. He observed that: \\u201c... It provides a right to assistance if the relevant conditions are satisfied. But this is not a pecuniary right, nor is the benefit that is to be provided defined by the application of specific rules laid down by the statute. Even where the full homelessness duty arises under section 193, the content of the statutory duty lacks precise definition. There is no private law analogy. The duty is expressed in broad terms \\u2013 to secure that \\u2018accommodation is available\\u2019 \\u2013 which leaves much to the discretionary administrative judgment of the authority.\\u201d\\n\\nHe continued, following a review of the jurisprudence of the Court, by noting that: \\u201c43. There are however ... a number of straws in the wind since Runa Begum that suggest that a distinction can indeed be made between the class of social security and welfare benefits that are of the kind exemplified by Salesi v Italy whose substance the domestic law defines precisely and those benefits which are, in their essence, dependent upon the exercise of judgment by the relevant authority ...\\u201d\\n\\nLater in his judgment, Lord Hope, for completeness, set out some observations on whether the scheme of decision-making was Article 6\\u2011compliant. He commented that the possibility, foreshadowed in argument, of separating simple, formal questions of \\u201cgateway\\u201d facts, such as the letter issue, from the expert assessment of suitability would needlessly complicate a scheme which was designed to be simple to administer.\\n\\nThe court went on to observe that the fact that a County Court did not have a full fact-finding jurisdiction when hearing an appeal under section 204 of the 1996 Act did not mean that the applicant was deprived of what was required to satisfy the guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention. In this connection, Lord Hope said this: \\u201c54. ... For ease of administration the review is entrusted to a single officer who is equipped to deal with issues as to the suitability of the accommodation that has been declined. An answer to the question whether or not the letters were received was incidental to a more searching and judgmental inquiry into the accommodation\\u2019s suitability. ... These cases are quite different from Tsfayo, where no broad questions requiring professional knowledge or experience had to be addressed once the question whether there was good cause had been answered. In these circumstances I would hold that the ratio of the decision in Runa Begum should be applied and that the absence of a full fact-finding jurisdiction in the court to which an appeal lies under section 204 does not deprive it of what it needs to satisfy the requirements of article 6(1).\\u201d\\n\\nUnlike the County Court, the Supreme Court appeared to consider whether or not the Council had discharged its duty to the applicant under section 193(5); however, it appeared to accept that a formal letter of offer was required by that subsection.\",\n          \"PROCEDURE\\n\\nThe case originated in an application (no. 41656/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\\u201cthe Convention\\u201d) by two Polish nationals, Mr Adam Mazgaj and his son, Mr Grzegorz Mazgaj (\\u201cthe applicants\\u201d), on 8 June 2001.\\n\\nThe applicants were represented by Mr S. Kotu\\u0142a, a lawyer practising in Lublin. The Polish Government (\\u201cthe Government\\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\\u0142\\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\\n\\nOn 25 May 2009 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \\u00a7 3 of the Convention).\\n\\nOn 24 September 2009 the Government requested the Court to sever the complaints of the applicants.\\n\\nOn 22 October 2009 the Court granted the Government's request and decided to sever the complaints of Adam Mazgaj (\\u201cthe applicant\\u201d) from the rest of the application.\\n\\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the restrictions placed on his contacts with his close family members when he was detained amounted to a violation of his right to respect for family life under Article 8 of the Convention.\\n\\nTHE FACTS\\n\\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\\n\\nThe applicant was born in 1928 and lives in W\\u0142odawa.\\n\\nA. The applicant's arrest and detention\\n\\nOn 28 June 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w District Court remanded the applicant in custody for two months. The court relied on a statement given on 27 June 2000 by the applicant's mentally ill son, G.M., who accused the applicant of homicide. The court also referred to the likelihood that a heavy penalty would be imposed on the applicant.\\n\\nOn an unspecified date the applicant appealed and requested that the preventive measure imposed on him be reduced in severity. He relied on his age (he was seventy-two years old at the time) and on the fact that he was undergoing medical treatment.\\n\\nOn 12 July 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court, relying on the same grounds as the District Court, upheld the challenged decision.\\n\\nOn 23 August 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor requested the court to extend the applicant's detention.\\n\\nOn 25 August 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w District Court granted the request and extended the applicant's detention for another month, until 28 September 2000.\\n\\nOn an unspecified date the applicant's lawyer appealed against that decision.\\n\\nOn 12 September 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court upheld the challenged decision. The court recognised that the only evidence against the applicant was the statement by the applicant's son, who had undergone a psychiatric examination. It stressed, however, that according to the results of the psychiatric report, the applicant's son's mental condition had improved. The court also relied on the risk that the applicant could obstruct the proceedings.\\n\\nThe Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court, relying on the same grounds as previously, extended the applicant's detention on 22 September 2000 for three months, and then, on 22 December 2000 for a further three months.\\n\\nThe applicant and his lawyer appealed against the latter decision.\\n\\nOn 18 January 2001 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Court of Appeal gave a decision and released the applicant. The court referred to a psychiatric opinion of 2 January 2001 concerning the applicant's son and found that his statements could not be considered reliable evidence.\\n\\nB. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\\n\\nOn 20 December 2001 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court gave judgment and acquitted the applicant.\\n\\nOn an unspecified date the Regional Rzesz\\u00f3w Prosecutor appealed against that judgment.\\n\\nOn 9 May 2002 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Court of Appeal upheld the first\\u2011instance judgment.\\n\\nC. Proceedings for compensation for manifestly unjustified detention of the applicant\\n\\nOn an unspecified date the applicant lodged a claim for compensation for manifestly unjustified detention with the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court.\\n\\nOn an unspecified date the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court gave judgment, against which the applicant appealed.\\n\\nOn 22 December 2004 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Court of Appeal remitted the case.\\n\\nOn 29 June 2005 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court granted the applicant compensation in the amount of 10,360 Polish zlotys (PLN).\\n\\nThe applicant appealed against that judgment, arguing that the instructions given by the Court of Appeal, which had remitted the case, had not been followed.\\n\\nOn 22 September 2005 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Court of Appeal granted the appeal in part, amended the first-instance judgment and increased the compensation to PLN 10,809. The court considered that the compensation should also include the travelling costs borne by the applicant's family to visit him in prison.\\n\\nD. Restrictions placed on the applicant's contact with his family\\n\\nOn 10 July 2000 J.M., the applicant's wife, and R.M., the applicant's second son, asked the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor for permission to see the applicant. They also requested information on the applicant's state of health.\\n\\nAccording to the applicant's submissions the prosecutor did not reply to their request.\\n\\nOn 3 August 2000 the applicant's lawyer requested the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor to allow him to see his wife and son. He relied on the applicant's age and state of health.\\n\\nOn 17 August 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor refused to allow the applicant personal contact with his family. The refusal was motivated by the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation (z uwagi na dobro tocz\\u0105cego si\\u0119 \\u015bledztwa).\\n\\nOn 21 September 2000 J.M. and R.M. again requested the prosecutor to allow them to visit the applicant. They submitted that for almost three months they had been denied personal contact with the close family members. Apparently this request remained unanswered.\\n\\nAccording to the findings of the Court of Appeal which examined the matter of the applicant's family's visits in prison for the purposes of calculating their travelling costs, the applicant's son visited him twice in the hospital wing of the Krak\\u00f3w Remand Centre on 14 October and 18 November 2000, and once, on 7 January 2001, in the Remand Centre itself. The applicant's wife was allowed to see her husband on 14 January 2001.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"task\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1008,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Task: Annotate the document to anonymise the following person: Gis\\u00e8le Augusto\",\n          \"Task: Annotate the document to anonymise the following person: Richard John Powell\",\n          \"Task: Annotate the document to anonymise the following person: Cengiz B\\u00fcker\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"meta\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"doc_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1014,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"001-71817\",\n          \"001-158031\",\n          \"001-100543\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"entity_mentions\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The Turkish Government (\\u201cthe Government\\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\\n\\nOn 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \\u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 \\u00a7 1).\\n\\nOn 13 January 2005 the Court joined the applications. It further decided to declare the applications partly inadmissible and to communicate the complaints concerning the lack of prompt and detailed information on the nature and cause of the accusations, and the non-communication to the applicants of the submissions of the Principal Public Prosecutor to the Court of Cassation. Under Article 29 \\u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.\\n\\nThe applicants and the Government each filed observations on the admissibility and merits (Rule 59 \\u00a7 1).\\n\\nTHE FACTS\\n\\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\\n\\nThe applicants were born in 1973, 1975, and 1980 respectively. They were detained in Elaz\\u0131\\u011f Prison in Turkey.\\n\\nOn 14 March 1999 the police raided a flat which was used as a cell by Hezbollah in Mardin. The police officers seized, among other things, three computer hard disks during the operation. The applicants' names were recorded on these hard disks as members of Hezbollah.\\n\\nOn 4 June 1999 the applicants were arrested by police officers from the anti-terror branch of the Diyarbak\\u0131r Security Directorate on suspicion of being members of Hezbollah. On the same day, the police officers drafted arrest protocols stating that the applicants had been arrested in the course of an operation conducted against the members of the illegal organisation.\\n\\nOn 5 June 1999 the public prosecutor of the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court drew up a list of the materials that were seized during the raid in Mardin in order to place them in the custody of the court, amongst which the computer hard disks were noted.\\n\\nOn 11 June 1999 the applicants gave statements to the police where they accepted the charges against them. On the same day, they were brought before the public prosecutor, and thereafter before the investigating judge of the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court, where they denied both the accuracy of the statements taken by the police and all the charges against them. The investigating judge ordered that the applicants be detained on remand.\\n\\nOn 25 June 1999 the public prosecutor filed an indictment with the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court, accusing the applicants of being members of Hezbollah pursuant to Article 168 \\u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code.\\n\\nAt the hearings before the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court the applicants denied the content of their police statements alleging that they were taken under duress. The court read out the police statements that were taken from M.\\u00c7., M.P. and A.Y. \\u2013 who were also accused of being members of the same organisation \\u2013 to the applicants and asked the latter to comment on them. The applicants stated that they did not know these persons, and that they did not accept the parts of the statements that were against them. The court further read out the transcriptions of the hard disks to the applicants and asked them about their counter-arguments against these. They denied the content of these documents. They further stated that they had no idea as to how their names had appeared on the computer hard disks.\\n\\nOn 27 December 2001 the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court noted that the applicants' police statements were supported by information gathered from the archive of the organisation and further evidence. It accordingly convicted the applicants of the offence as charged and sentenced them to twelve years and six months' imprisonment. The applicants appealed.\\n\\nThe Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation in his written submissions recommended that the court uphold the decision of the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court.\\n\\nOn 27 May 2002 the Court of Cassation, having regard, inter alia, to the opinion of the Principal Prosecutor, upheld the judgment of the Diyarbak\\u0131r State Security Court.\",\n          \"PROCEDURE\\n\\nThe case originated in an application (no. 40378/10) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\\u201cthe Convention\\u201d) by a British national, Ms Fazia Ali (\\u201cthe applicant\\u201d), on 15 July 2010.\\n\\nThe applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Birmingham. She is represented before the Court by Mr M. McIlvaney of the Community Law Partnership, a solicitor practising in Birmingham.\\n\\nThe United Kingdom Government (\\u201cthe Government\\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms R. Tomlinson of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\\n\\nOn 7 November 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.\\n\\nTHE FACTS\\n\\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\\n\\nThe applicant, a parent of two young children, is a homeless person in priority need of accommodation within the meaning of Part VII of the Housing Act 1996 (\\u201cthe 1996 Act\\u201d).\\n\\nBirmingham City Council (\\u201cthe Council\\u201d) is a local housing authority within the meaning of the 1996 Act and is required, under Part VII of that Act, to perform statutory functions in relation to homeless persons in its area.\\n\\nThe applicant applied as a homeless person to Birmingham City Council for assistance in October 2006. By letter dated 7 November 2006 the Council determined that the applicant was homeless, eligible for assistance, in priority need and not intentionally homeless. The authority therefore accepted that it owed the applicant the \\u201cmain housing duty\\u201d to provide accommodation to her and her family. On 8 November 2006 the authority made the applicant an offer of accommodation which she refused because she was unhappy with the location. The authority told the applicant that in its view the accommodation was suitable but following a review of that decision, which was determined in the applicant\\u2019s favour, they agreed to make her another offer.\\n\\nOn 14 March 2007 a Housing Officer informed the applicant by telephone that another offer was being made, that a viewing had been arranged and that a letter would follow. The authority claims that on that same day a written offer of accommodation at 16 Bromford Lane, Birmingham was sent to the applicant. That letter contained a statement to the effect that if the applicant refused the offer without good cause the authority would consider that it had discharged its duty to her under Part VII of the 1996 Act. However, the applicant denied receiving the letter; instead, she claimed that she had to telephone the housing office to obtain the address and arrange the viewing appointment. She viewed the property on 19 March 2007 but declined the offer as she was not happy with the condition of the communal area.\\n\\nBy letter dated 21 March 2007 the Council notified the applicant that, by reason of her rejection of its offer, pursuant to section 193 of the Housing Act its duty to her under Part VII of the 1996 Act had been discharged. By letter dated 29 March 2007 the applicant notified the Council that she had not received an offer in writing and requested that the Council review its decision.\\n\\nWhile the applicant\\u2019s case was pending before the review panel, a further offer of accommodation was made to her pursuant to a different scheme, namely the scheme for the provision of housing accommodation under Part VI of the 1996 Act. She did not accept this offer.\\n\\nOn 1 May 2007 a Homelessness Review Officer employed by the Council conducted a telephone interview with the applicant to establish her reasons for refusing the offer of accommodation at 16 Bromford Lane. The Officer claimed that in the course of this conversation the applicant accepted that she had in fact received the offer letter but refused the offer of accommodation because there was no lift and the entrance to the property was dirty, which could put her youngest son\\u2019s health at risk. However, the applicant claims that at the time she had thought she was being questioned about the subsequent offer of accommodation, in respect of which she did not deny having received a letter.\\n\\nBy letter dated 2 May 2007 the Homelessness Review Officer upheld the decision that the applicant\\u2019s refusal of the offer of accommodation had discharged the Council\\u2019s main housing duty to her under section 193(2) of the 1996 Act. In particular, the Officer found that the applicant had been sent an offer letter from the Council which complied with the mandatory requirements of section 193 of the 1996 Act prior to her refusal and there was no reason to believe that she had not received it. In any case, she noted that the applicant had not refused the accommodation because she had not received a written offer but because she did not consider the accommodation to be suitable for her family\\u2019s needs.\\n\\nThe applicant appealed to Birmingham County Court under section 204 of the 1996 Act, which allowed for an appeal on a point of law only. The jurisdiction exercised by the County Court under section 204 was that of judicial review. In her grounds of appeal the applicant claimed that the Council, in reaching its decision, had taken into account irrelevant considerations and/or acted under a fundamental mistake of fact; that the Council had acted unlawfully as it had failed to make adequate inquiries to enable it to reach a lawful decision; that its decision was one which no rational Council would have made; that it had fettered its discretion; and that it had acted in breach of natural justice.\\n\\nThe appeal was heard on 29 August 2007, on which date the judge noted that the only ground of appeal argued before him was that the letter of offer had failed to arrive. The applicant submitted that the County Court should hear evidence on the matter so that it could determine it for itself. However, although the judge accepted that the Homelessness Review Officer was not an independent or impartial tribunal, he found that the decision whether or not the letter had been received was properly and fairly to be made by her and he declined to hear evidence on the point. Although it was not specifically stated in the correspondence between the Council and the applicant, the judge appeared to consider whether or not the Council had discharged its duty under section 193(7) (see paragraph 25 below).\\n\\nThe applicant subsequently appealed to the Court of Appeal and then to the Supreme Court. At each level, the grounds of appeal were that the decision taken by the Council\\u2019s Homelessness Review Officer had constituted a determination of the applicant\\u2019s civil rights for the purposes of Article 6 \\u00a7 1 of the Convention; that the Officer had not been an independent or impartial tribunal as required by Article 6 \\u00a7 1; that the decision of the Officer had turned on the resolution of a simple question of disputed primary fact, involving no application of specialist knowledge; that pursuant to Tsfayo v. the United Kingdom, no. 60860/00, 14 November 2006, Article 6 \\u00a7 1 required that the applicant be able to appeal that simple factual determination; and, alternatively, that the restriction of all statutory appeals to points of law, no matter what the nature of the decision, was incompatible with Article 6 \\u00a7 1.\\n\\nBoth the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court decision on the applicant\\u2019s appeal followed the decision of the House of Lords in Runa Begum v. London Borough of Tower Hamlets [2003] UKHL 5. In Runa Begum the House of Lords found that judicial review of a Homelessness Review Officer\\u2019s decision that a claimant had been unreasonable in rejecting the accommodation offered to her provided \\u201csufficiency of review\\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 \\u00a7 1. The House of Lords stressed that although the Officer had been called upon to resolve some disputed factual issues, these findings of fact were \\u201conly staging posts on the way to the much broader judgments\\u201d concerning local conditions and the availability of alternative accommodation, which the Officer had the specialist knowledge and experience to make. Although the Officer could not be regarded as independent, since she was employed by the Council which had made the offer of accommodation which the claimant had rejected, statutory regulations provided substantial safeguards to ensure that the review would be independently and fairly conducted, free from improper external influences. Any significant departure from the procedural rules would have afforded a ground of appeal.\\n\\nThe applicant submitted that the present case could be distinguished from that of Runa Begum because it concerned the simple question of a finding of primary fact rather than an evaluative judgment, such as a qualitative assessment of \\u201csuitability\\u201d.\\n\\nA. The judgment of the Court of Appeal\\n\\nOn 7 November 2008 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\\u2019s appeal. In doing so, it proceeded on the assumption that the case involved the determination of the applicant\\u2019s civil rights for the purposes of Article 6 \\u00a7 1 of the Convention. In relation to the question whether the decision of the Homelessness Review Officer had turned on the resolution of a simple question of primary fact, or whether it required the application of specialist knowledge, Thomas LJ stated that: \\u201ci) It is far from easy to draw the distinction advanced in practice. A finding of suitability is itself a finding based on conclusions of primary fact ... ii) There would be considerable complexity in administering a scheme with these distinctions. A scheme which enabled certain factual issues to be subject to a full right of appeal and others which would not be so subject would be too uncertain and too complex ... iii) ... [I]f the extent of the review by the court was determined by the answer to the questions of whether a finding of fact was a primary finding, or whether that finding required expertise or whether that finding was determinative, the room for argument and uncertainty would be considerable ... .... v) The additional review which would be provided by the suggested full right of appeal on fact would not in practice be very wide ... vi) The full right of appeal sought from a review officer on fact might have to be significantly different from an appeal from a court ... the procedure adopted by the reviewing officer in reaching findings of fact is informal and there are no transcripts of evidence. .... viii) There would therefore clearly be significant implications for not only the statutory scheme but for the court and tribunal system, if this court were to hold that a full right of appeal was required on findings of primary fact or on issues of primary fact where the finding was determinative ... The statutory scheme for housing and the statutory scheme for the method of appeals in respect of courts and tribunals are determined by Parliament; funds are provided for their finance by Parliament ... ix) The present scope of the appeal provides a real measure of protection for homeless appellants. It is clear from the careful judgments of Judge MacDuff QC and Judge McKenna that both considered that the housing authority had fairly treated both appellants in cases where the determinative issue was a question of fact. This conclusion reinforces the view I have expressed that the review by the County Court in cases of this kind was sufficient and that there is no reason to attempt to find that it is outside the scope of the decision in Runa Begum. It demonstrates, as Lord Bingham observed at paragraph 11, that the scheme properly operated should ensure fair treatment. I consider that it does whether the decision turns on a simple issue of primary fact or a conclusion of fact based on primary facts (such as a conclusion on suitability).\\u201d\\n\\nThomas LJ therefore concluded that the decision of the House of Lords in Runa Begum applied to all County Court appeals under section 204 of the 1996 Act, no matter whether the decision turned on a simple issue of primary fact or not. He further held that the decision in Tsfayo, which concerned the housing benefit scheme, did not affect appeals brought in homelessness cases: \\u201c34. ... In the first place the Strasbourg Court relied on the decision in Runa Begum in reaching its conclusion and said nothing that cast doubt on the correctness of the decision. Secondly, the decisions in Runa Begum and Tsfayo each turned on a careful examination of the whole of the statutory scheme relevant to the particular case. Thirdly, it is apparent from the details of the scheme considered in Tsfayo that whereas in the case of prospective benefit, central government reimbursed the local authority 95% of what it was required to pay, it only reimbursed 50% of backdated awards (see paragraph 19 of the decision); this fact had been heavily relied upon in argument (see paragraph 37 of the decision) for the powerful contention that the hearing had taken place before a tribunal consisting of members of an authority which would be required to pay 50% of the benefit if it made an award in the applicant\\u2019s favour; the HBRB was not independent of the parties. Finally when the housing benefits scheme was looked upon as a whole, it was readily apparent that a conclusion could be reached, in contradistinction to the scheme under Part VII of the Housing Act, that the particular scheme was not compliant with Article 6.1.\\u201d\\n\\nB. The judgment of the Supreme Court\\n\\nOn 17 February 2010 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\\u2019s appeal, finding that the determination by the Council, that its duty to secure accommodation for the applicant had ceased, was not a determination of her civil rights within the meaning of Article 6. Lord Hope of Craighead with whom Baroness Hale and Lord Brown agreed, stated that: \\u201c... I would be prepared now to hold that cases where the award of services or benefits in kind is not an individual right of which the applicant can consider himself the holder, but is dependent upon a series of evaluative judgments by the provider as to whether the statutory criteria are satisfied and how the need for it ought to be met, do not engage article 6(1). In my opinion they do not give rise to \\u2018civil rights\\u2019 within the autonomous meaning that is given to that expression for the purposes of that article.\\u201d\\n\\nIn supporting that conclusion Lord Hope looked to what the relevant provisions within Part VII of the 1996 Act were intended to achieve. He observed that: \\u201c... It provides a right to assistance if the relevant conditions are satisfied. But this is not a pecuniary right, nor is the benefit that is to be provided defined by the application of specific rules laid down by the statute. Even where the full homelessness duty arises under section 193, the content of the statutory duty lacks precise definition. There is no private law analogy. The duty is expressed in broad terms \\u2013 to secure that \\u2018accommodation is available\\u2019 \\u2013 which leaves much to the discretionary administrative judgment of the authority.\\u201d\\n\\nHe continued, following a review of the jurisprudence of the Court, by noting that: \\u201c43. There are however ... a number of straws in the wind since Runa Begum that suggest that a distinction can indeed be made between the class of social security and welfare benefits that are of the kind exemplified by Salesi v Italy whose substance the domestic law defines precisely and those benefits which are, in their essence, dependent upon the exercise of judgment by the relevant authority ...\\u201d\\n\\nLater in his judgment, Lord Hope, for completeness, set out some observations on whether the scheme of decision-making was Article 6\\u2011compliant. He commented that the possibility, foreshadowed in argument, of separating simple, formal questions of \\u201cgateway\\u201d facts, such as the letter issue, from the expert assessment of suitability would needlessly complicate a scheme which was designed to be simple to administer.\\n\\nThe court went on to observe that the fact that a County Court did not have a full fact-finding jurisdiction when hearing an appeal under section 204 of the 1996 Act did not mean that the applicant was deprived of what was required to satisfy the guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention. In this connection, Lord Hope said this: \\u201c54. ... For ease of administration the review is entrusted to a single officer who is equipped to deal with issues as to the suitability of the accommodation that has been declined. An answer to the question whether or not the letters were received was incidental to a more searching and judgmental inquiry into the accommodation\\u2019s suitability. ... These cases are quite different from Tsfayo, where no broad questions requiring professional knowledge or experience had to be addressed once the question whether there was good cause had been answered. In these circumstances I would hold that the ratio of the decision in Runa Begum should be applied and that the absence of a full fact-finding jurisdiction in the court to which an appeal lies under section 204 does not deprive it of what it needs to satisfy the requirements of article 6(1).\\u201d\\n\\nUnlike the County Court, the Supreme Court appeared to consider whether or not the Council had discharged its duty to the applicant under section 193(5); however, it appeared to accept that a formal letter of offer was required by that subsection.\",\n          \"PROCEDURE\\n\\nThe case originated in an application (no. 41656/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\\u201cthe Convention\\u201d) by two Polish nationals, Mr Adam Mazgaj and his son, Mr Grzegorz Mazgaj (\\u201cthe applicants\\u201d), on 8 June 2001.\\n\\nThe applicants were represented by Mr S. Kotu\\u0142a, a lawyer practising in Lublin. The Polish Government (\\u201cthe Government\\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\\u0142\\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\\n\\nOn 25 May 2009 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \\u00a7 3 of the Convention).\\n\\nOn 24 September 2009 the Government requested the Court to sever the complaints of the applicants.\\n\\nOn 22 October 2009 the Court granted the Government's request and decided to sever the complaints of Adam Mazgaj (\\u201cthe applicant\\u201d) from the rest of the application.\\n\\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the restrictions placed on his contacts with his close family members when he was detained amounted to a violation of his right to respect for family life under Article 8 of the Convention.\\n\\nTHE FACTS\\n\\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\\n\\nThe applicant was born in 1928 and lives in W\\u0142odawa.\\n\\nA. The applicant's arrest and detention\\n\\nOn 28 June 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w District Court remanded the applicant in custody for two months. The court relied on a statement given on 27 June 2000 by the applicant's mentally ill son, G.M., who accused the applicant of homicide. The court also referred to the likelihood that a heavy penalty would be imposed on the applicant.\\n\\nOn an unspecified date the applicant appealed and requested that the preventive measure imposed on him be reduced in severity. He relied on his age (he was seventy-two years old at the time) and on the fact that he was undergoing medical treatment.\\n\\nOn 12 July 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court, relying on the same grounds as the District Court, upheld the challenged decision.\\n\\nOn 23 August 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor requested the court to extend the applicant's detention.\\n\\nOn 25 August 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w District Court granted the request and extended the applicant's detention for another month, until 28 September 2000.\\n\\nOn an unspecified date the applicant's lawyer appealed against that decision.\\n\\nOn 12 September 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court upheld the challenged decision. The court recognised that the only evidence against the applicant was the statement by the applicant's son, who had undergone a psychiatric examination. It stressed, however, that according to the results of the psychiatric report, the applicant's son's mental condition had improved. The court also relied on the risk that the applicant could obstruct the proceedings.\\n\\nThe Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court, relying on the same grounds as previously, extended the applicant's detention on 22 September 2000 for three months, and then, on 22 December 2000 for a further three months.\\n\\nThe applicant and his lawyer appealed against the latter decision.\\n\\nOn 18 January 2001 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Court of Appeal gave a decision and released the applicant. The court referred to a psychiatric opinion of 2 January 2001 concerning the applicant's son and found that his statements could not be considered reliable evidence.\\n\\nB. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\\n\\nOn 20 December 2001 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court gave judgment and acquitted the applicant.\\n\\nOn an unspecified date the Regional Rzesz\\u00f3w Prosecutor appealed against that judgment.\\n\\nOn 9 May 2002 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Court of Appeal upheld the first\\u2011instance judgment.\\n\\nC. Proceedings for compensation for manifestly unjustified detention of the applicant\\n\\nOn an unspecified date the applicant lodged a claim for compensation for manifestly unjustified detention with the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court.\\n\\nOn an unspecified date the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court gave judgment, against which the applicant appealed.\\n\\nOn 22 December 2004 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Court of Appeal remitted the case.\\n\\nOn 29 June 2005 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Court granted the applicant compensation in the amount of 10,360 Polish zlotys (PLN).\\n\\nThe applicant appealed against that judgment, arguing that the instructions given by the Court of Appeal, which had remitted the case, had not been followed.\\n\\nOn 22 September 2005 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Court of Appeal granted the appeal in part, amended the first-instance judgment and increased the compensation to PLN 10,809. The court considered that the compensation should also include the travelling costs borne by the applicant's family to visit him in prison.\\n\\nD. Restrictions placed on the applicant's contact with his family\\n\\nOn 10 July 2000 J.M., the applicant's wife, and R.M., the applicant's second son, asked the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor for permission to see the applicant. They also requested information on the applicant's state of health.\\n\\nAccording to the applicant's submissions the prosecutor did not reply to their request.\\n\\nOn 3 August 2000 the applicant's lawyer requested the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor to allow him to see his wife and son. He relied on the applicant's age and state of health.\\n\\nOn 17 August 2000 the Rzesz\\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor refused to allow the applicant personal contact with his family. The refusal was motivated by the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation (z uwagi na dobro tocz\\u0105cego si\\u0119 \\u015bledztwa).\\n\\nOn 21 September 2000 J.M. and R.M. again requested the prosecutor to allow them to visit the applicant. They submitted that for almost three months they had been denied personal contact with the close family members. Apparently this request remained unanswered.\\n\\nAccording to the findings of the Court of Appeal which examined the matter of the applicant's family's visits in prison for the purposes of calculating their travelling costs, the applicant's son visited him twice in the hospital wing of the Krak\\u00f3w Remand Centre on 14 October and 18 November 2000, and once, on 7 January 2001, in the Remand Centre itself. The applicant's wife was allowed to see her husband on 14 January 2001.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"meta\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"doc_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1014,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"001-71817\",\n          \"001-158031\",\n          \"001-100543\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
