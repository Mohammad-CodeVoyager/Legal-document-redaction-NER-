Under the provisions of Article 29 \\u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\\n\\nTHE FACTS\\n\\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\\n\\nThe applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Bytom.\\n\\n1. The applicant's detention\\n\\nOn 21 October 2002 the applicant was arrested. By a decision of 24 October 2002 the District Court in Wodzis\\u0142aw \\u015al\\u0105ski remanded him in custody on charges connected with organised crime. It had regard to evidence gathered by the prosecuting authorities which indicated that the applicant had committed the offences concerned. The applicant appealed, to no avail.\\n\\nThe same court subsequently extended the applicant's detention by decisions of, inter alia, 10 July and 7 October 2003 and 7 March 2004, until, respectively, 15 October 2003, 19 January and 19 July 2004. The court relied on the evidence gathered in the case which pointed to the likelihood of the applicant's guilt. It was also of the view that the applicant, if released, could hinder the proper course of the investigations and judicial proceedings by exerting pressure on witnesses and by colluding with his co-accused. It noted that many persons appeared to have been involved in the commission of the offences concerned and that it was therefore necessary to obtain a considerable amount of evidence. It also had regard to the applicant's criminal record.\\n\\nOn numerous other occasions the prosecuting authorities refused to release the applicant, relying on the same arguments and referring to the evidence gathered in the investigation.\\n\\nOn an unspecified number of occasions the applicant was allowed to see his wife during his detention. Between 15 December 2002, the date on which the applicant's wife gave birth to a son, and 21 November 2003 the applicant saw her and his son on at least three occasions.\\n\\nOn 30 September 2003 the prosecuting authorities lodged a bill of indictment with the Wodzislaw \\u015al\\u0105ski District Court. The applicant was charged with multiple counts of fraud.\\n\\nOn 11 December 2003 the court ordered that the applicant should serve a prison sentence imposed on him by a final judgment given in another criminal case concurrently with the present detention.\\n\\nHearings in the case were held on 7 January, 18 February and 25 October 2004. On the latter date the applicant was convicted as charged.\\n\\n2. Censorship of the applicant's correspondence\\n\\nThe applicant submitted envelopes of two letters sent to him by the Court on 15 January 2004 and 30 March 2004. The envelope of the first letter bears the stamp \\u201cCensored (cenzurowano) \\u2013 the Wodzis\\u0142aw \\u015al\\u0105ski District Court \\u2013 Date\\u201d, signed with an illegible signature. The envelope of the second letter bears the full official stamp of the Wodzis\\u0142aw \\u015al\\u0105ski District Court and a handwritten note \\u201ccensorship\\u201d (cenzura), accompanied by a handwritten date, 9 April 2004.\",\n          \"PROCEDURE\\n\\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36244/06) against the Kingdom of Denmark lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\\u201cthe Convention\\u201d) by a Danish national, Mr Henrik Hasslund (\\u201cthe applicant\\u201d), on 31 August 2006.\\n\\nThe applicant was represented by Mr Tyge Trier, a lawyer practising in Copenhagen. The Danish Government (\\u201cthe Government\\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms Nina Holst-Christensen of the Ministry of Justice.\\n\\nOn 5 September 2007 the Acting President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \\u00a7 3).\\n\\nTHE FACTS\\n\\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\\n\\nThe applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Les Salles Sur Verdon, France.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the 1990s a new concept called \\u201ctax asset stripping cases\\u201d (selskabst\\u00f8mmersager) came into existence in Denmark. It covered a criminal activity by which the persons involved committed aggravated debtor fraud by buying up and selling numerous inactive, solvent private limited companies within a short period and, for the sake of their own profit, \\u201cstripping\\u201d the companies of assets, including deposits earmarked for payment of corporation tax. The persons involved were usually intricately interconnected and collaborated in their economic criminal activities, which concerned very large amounts of money. According to surveys made by the customs and tax authorities, approximately one thousand six hundred companies with a total tax debt exceeding two billion Danish kroner (DKK) were stripped in the period from the late 1980s until 1994. Following a number of legislative amendments, the trade in inactive, solvent companies largely ceased in the summer of 1993.\\n\\nIn 1994, the applicant learnt via a local newspaper that he was the subject of an investigation, as was a private limited stockbrokers company, of which he was part owner.\\n\\nBy letter of 9 June 1994 he informed the police that he was available for an interview, if required. By letter of 14 June 1994 the police confirmed that they were in the process of investigation and informed the applicant that they would talk to him at a later stage.\\n\\nFrom November 1994 to September 1995, six discovery orders were issued against two banks, four search warrants were issued and numerous interviews were held.\\n\\nOn 19 September 1995 the applicant was arrested and charged, inter alia, with aggravated debtor fraud. On the same day he was detained in solitary confinement, which was prolonged at regular intervals until he was released on 22 December 1995.\\n\\nOn the latter date, an oral hearing took place before the Copenhagen City Court (K\\u00f8benhavns Byret - hereafter \\u201cthe City Court\\u201d), during which the prosecution stated that the investigation was concluded and that the indictment could be expected at the beginning of 1996.\\n\\nFrom January 1996 to June 1998 various investigative steps were taken, notably relating to five co-accused in the case, for example searches in Denmark, Switzerland and Sweden, numerous interviews in Denmark and abroad, international letters of request, a request to Interpol, fifteen discovery orders and an order prohibiting the disclosure of the applicant\\u2019s name. Moreover, on 19 March 1997 a request for an accountant\\u2019s report was made and material for that purpose was obtained, including statements of account, cheque vouchers and so on.\\n\\nOn 25 June 1998, the indictment was submitted to the City Court according to which the applicant (and five co-accused: A, B, N, M and R) were charged of \\u201ctax asset stripping\\u201d committed jointly. The applicant was charged with fifteen counts out of a total of fifty-nine committed between March 1992 and May 1993. His responsibility related to an amount of DKK 9,890,000 (approximately 1,300,000 euros (EUR)) out of the total amount of tax evaded in the case which came to approximately EUR 19,000,000.\\n\\nBetween 14 August 1998 and 10 March 1999, fifteen pre-trial hearings were held and the draft of the accountant\\u2019s reports was submitted. On the former date, the case was set down for trial on 15 March 1999.\\n\\nBetween 15 March 1999 and 31 January 2001, a total of 119 hearings were held. The applicant, the five co-accused and more than seventy witnesses were heard, including state-registered public accountants. Statements of accounts and a considerable amount of other documentary evidence were also produced. The court records comprised 1,330 pages. The closing speeches were held over ten days in November 2000 and January 2001.\\n\\nBy a judgment of 6 April 2001, which ran to 220 pages, the City Court convicted the applicant in accordance with the indictment, but on one count he was acquitted. The co-accused were also convicted. The applicant was sentenced to two years\\u2019 imprisonment. In addition, an amount of DKK 2,200,000 was seized, and he was deprived for an indefinite period of his right to establish a private limited company or a company or an association requiring public approval, or to become a manager and/or member of a director\\u2019s board of such companies.\\n\\nThe City Court dismissed the applicant\\u2019s claim that the length of the proceedings had been at variance with Article 6 of the Convention, stating the following: \\u201cThe City Court finds no reason to criticise the prosecution\\u2019s decision to join the criminal proceedings against the [applicant and the five co\\u2011accused]. Accordingly, and having regard to the mutual connection between the cases and their character, the City Court finds no violation of Article 6 of the Convention, although there were longer periods of inactivity during one part of the case, while investigation was going on in another part of the case. In this connection [the City Court] notes that the complexity of the acts carried out by [the applicant and the five co-accused] partly when buying and \\u201cstripping\\u201d the companies for assets, partly when writing off projects abroad, necessitated an investigation of an extraordinary scope. In the City Court\\u2019s opinion there were no longer periods, whether before the police, the prosecution or the City Court, during which no part of the case proceeded. It must be emphasised that due to the nature and scope of the charges, the cases against [M] and [the co-accused B and R] could not proceed before the cases against [the applicant, N and A] [had been heard]. [Finally], in view of the character and complexity of the case, [the City Court] considers that the total length of the proceedings did not in itself constitute a breach of the said provision of the Convention.\\u201d\\n\\nOn 15 May 2001 the applicant and the five co-accused appealed against the judgment to the High Court of Eastern Denmark (\\u00d8stre Landsret - \\u201cthe High Court\\u201d).\\n\\nAfter that date, twelve preparatory hearings were held, including one on 13 September 2001 during which the trial was scheduled with numerous fixed dates to commence on 24 September 2002. Counsel for the applicant and the co-defendants jointly replied that they only had very limited possibilities to appear during the autumn of 2002.\\n\\nThus, although the trial commenced on 24 September 2002, most of the hearings took place in 2003 and 2004. A total of about 90 hearings were held in the case. In February and March 2004 the appeal hearings had to be postponed because the applicant fell ill. For the same reason the High Court changed the order of some of the hearings. The Court records comprised 861 pages. The closing speeches were held over ten days in April, May, and June 2004.\\n\\nOn 28 September 2004 the High Court upheld the City Court\\u2019s judgment. As regards the length of the proceedings, it stated: \\u201cIn the assessment of whether the proceedings have been concluded within a reasonable time, the starting point ... concerning the [applicant] was on 19 September 1995, when he was charged ... [The High Court] upholds the City Court\\u2019s judgment and its reasoning with regard to the question of whether Article 6 of the Convention has been violated ... The appeal proceedings were scheduled and carried out without any unreasonable delay. On 13 September 2001 the trial was scheduled to take place on fixed dates as from 12 August 2002. A number of hearing dates in the autumn 2002 and the beginning of 2003 had to be cancelled because some counsel were occupied [with other cases], for which reason the [present] case was delayed. To avoid any further delay caused by impossibilities to appear, the trial, which commenced on 24 September 2002, proceeded in a proper, but not completely suitable order.\\u201d\\n\\nIn the period from 7 to 12 October 2004, the applicant and the co\\u2011defendants requested that the Leave to Appeal Board (Procesbevillingsn\\u00e6vnet) grant them leave to appeal to the Supreme Court (H\\u00f8jesteret). Three of the defendants stated in their petitions that they would submit supplementary comments, which were received on 17 December 2004. In January 2005 the cases were sent to the prosecution, which gave its opinion on 29 March 2005. The applicant and the co\\u2011defendants gave their comments in reply and at a meeting on 5 August 2005 the Leave to Appeal Board decided to refuse the requests. Letters of refusal were not sent out, however, as on 9 August 2005 counsel for one of the co-defendants stated that he wanted to submit supplementary comments in the light of a recent judgment in a similar case.\\n\\nThereafter, due to an error, nothing happened in the case until 2 May 2006, when the police telephoned the Leave to Appeal Board and drew attention to the case. Subsequently, on his request, counsel for the relevant co-defendant who had wanted to submit supplementary comments did so on 2 and 13 June 2006. The applicant and the co-defendant were informed on 21 June 2006 that their requests for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court had been refused.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"task\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Task: Annotate the document to anonymise the following person: D.

        "For the mathematical modeling, I implemented Word2Vec with the Skip-gram architecture. I chose this specific approach because it captures semantic relationships much better than other methods when working with a dataset of our size. The core idea is simple: since computers can't understand raw text, we map every word to a geometric vector with 100 coordinates. Initially, these positions are random, but during training, the model moves words with similar meanings closer together in this 100-dimensional space.The training process works by taking a \"center word\" and trying to predict the context words around it. Mathematically, we measure the similarity between words using the dot product of their vectors. However, since a dot product can be negative, we pass it through a Softmax function. This uses exponents ($e^x$) to ensure all values become positive probabilities, which are then normalized by the sum of all possible word relationships in the dictionary.To make the optimization stable, I used Log Probabilities. This is a necessary mathematical trick: if we simply multiplied thousands of tiny probabilities, the computer would round the result to zero (arithmetic underflow). By using logarithms, we transform this multiplication into addition, allowing the model to learn efficiently without losing precision."
