The applicant was represented by Mr E. Kanar, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

On 6 November 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1965. He is currently detained in the Edirne F-type Prison.

On 6 February 1993 the applicant was arrested and placed in police custody by officers from the Anti-terror branch of the Istanbul Security Directorate on suspicion of involvement in the activities of an illegal armed organisation, the TKP/ML-TIKKO (the Turkish Communist Party/Marxist Leninist -Turkish Workers and Peasants' Liberation Army).

On 15 February 1993 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor and then the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court. On the same day the investigating judge remanded the applicant in custody pending trial.

By an indictment dated 5 April 1993, the public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant and nineteen other defendants before the Istanbul State Security Court, accusing them, inter alia, of membership of an illegal armed organisation and of involvement in activities which undermined the constitutional order of the State. The prosecution sought the death penalty under Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code.

In the course of the proceedings, the State Security Court rejected the applicant's requests for release, taking into account the nature of the alleged offence and the state of the evidence.

On 12 June 2000 the applicant was convicted as charged by the Istanbul State Security Court and sentenced to life imprisonment.

On 15 May 2001 the Court of Cassation quashed the applicant's conviction for procedural reasons. The case was remitted to the Istanbul State Security Court for further examination and the applicant remained in custody.

On 7 May 2004 State Security Courts were abolished following a constitutional amendment and the applicant's case was transmitted to the Istanbul Assize Court. In the course of the proceedings, the domestic courts rejected the applicant's requests for release, taking into account the nature of the alleged offence and the documents in the case file. The applicant challenged these decisions under Article 298 of the Criminal Procedure Code; however, the domestic courts rejected all his requests.

On 31 January 2005 the Istanbul Assize Court found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment under Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code.

On 20 March 2006 the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the Assize Court and the case file was remitted to Istanbul Assize Court.

On 4 October 2006 the applicant was released pending trial. According to the information in the case file, as submitted by the parties, the case is still pending before the Istanbul Assize Court.","{'applicant': 'Cengiz Polat', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 53, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2007}",001-83927

2,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 63354/00) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Aziz Canpolat (“the applicant”), on 15 September 2000.

The applicant was represented by Mr M. Güzeler, a lawyer practising in Şanlıurfa. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

On 31 May 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1950 and was detained in the Hilvan prison, in Şanlıurfa at the time of the application.

On 11 October 1997 following receipt of information that the applicant was in possession of narcotic substances, police officers from the Siverek Security Directorate arrested the applicant, his son and one of the applicant's employees, İ.Ş., in the applicant's house. During the search of the applicant's house and farm, a certain amount of cannabis was found.

On 12 October 1997 the suspects were brought before the Siverek Magistrates' Court who ordered their detention on remand.

On 14 October 1997, the Siverek Magistrates' Court sent the case file to the public prosecutor's office at the Diyarbakır State Security Court holding that the case concerned the prosecution of organised drug trafficking.

On 24 October 1997 the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant and the two other suspects. The public prosecutor charged them under Article 403 § 5 of the Criminal Code of being in possession of hashish with the aim of trafficking. İ.Ş. was also charged with the consummation of hashish.

On 26 May 1998 the Diyarbakır State Security Court convicted the applicant and İ.Ş. The applicant was sentenced to three years and four months' imprisonment.

On 5 October 1998 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court.

On 24 November 1998 the Diyarbakır State Security Court once again convicted the applicant and his co-accused and sentenced them to six years and three months' imprisonment.

On 15 April 1999 the Court of Cassation again quashed the first‑instance court's judgment, holding that the applicant's and his co‑accused's defence rights had not been respect as they had not been informed about the date of the hearing.

On 15 June 1999 the Diyarbakır State Security Court convicted the applicant and his co-accused and sentenced them to six years and three months' imprisonment. It also ordered their release from detention having regard to the time that they had spent in prison.

On 20 April 2000 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.","{'applicant': 'Aziz Canpolat', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2007}",001-79436
3,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 35574/97) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a national of the United Kingdom national, Ian Le Petit (“the applicant”), on 21 March 1997.

The applicant was represented by Mr J. Mackenzie, a lawyer practising in Oxfordshire. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by successive Agents, Mr Eaton, Mr Whomersley and Mr Grainger, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant mainly complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that his naval court-martial did not constitute a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

It was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.

On 1 November 2000 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1) and the case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1) .

By decision dated 5 December 2000, the Court declared the application partly admissible.

The Government filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Bristol. In 1974 he joined the Royal Navy. At the relevant time he held a senior non-commissioned rank and was an experienced administrator. On 20 October 1995 he was informed that he was under investigation on suspicion of travel fraud. Since he was to be interviewed by the naval police, he was offered the opportunity to speak to a naval barrister. He accepted this offer, was given legal advice and confirmed that he understood the advice given.

He then attended two interviews with the naval police. At the beginning of both interviews he was cautioned (section 76 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984). He declined the opportunity accorded to him to obtain legal advice and to have a legal adviser present at those interviews. He made certain admissions at his first interview and gave the investigators access to his bank accounts. On 27 November 1995 he was interviewed for a second time and then charged.

The charge sheet, as approved by the convening authority listed six charges (pursuant to section 42 of the Naval Discipline Act 1957) of obtaining property and a service by deception contrary to sections 1 and 15 of the Theft Act 1968. All charges related to the making of false representations about travel allowances.

By notice dated 3 July 1996 the convening authority ordered the convening of a court-martial to try the applicant on the charges. He appointed the members of the court-martial by name. All were subordinate to the convening authority but none served within his chain of command. The Judge Advocate was appointed by the Chief Naval Judge Advocate. While the Judge Advocate was subordinate in rank to the President and both served under the Second Sea Lord, there was no command or other substantive institutional link between them.

The court-martial took place on 8-10 July 1996. Once the applicant’s preliminary objections were rejected (he contested the admission of evidence from his interviews and he alleges that he challenged the composition of the court-martial), he pleaded guilty as charged. On 10 July 1996 he was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.

By letter dated 14 January 1997, his legal representative was informed of the decision taken by the Admiralty Board to reject his petition against conviction and sentence. It was considered that his admissions in interview were not the result of oppression and that, given the seriousness of the offences, his sentence was neither manifestly excessive nor wrong in principle.","{'applicant': 'Ian Le Petit', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2004}",001-61815

The Government filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Bristol. In 1974 he joined the Royal Navy. At the relevant time he held a senior non-commissioned rank and was an experienced administrator. On 20 October 1995 he was informed that he was under investigation on suspicion of travel fraud. Since he was to be interviewed by the naval police, he was offered the opportunity to speak to a naval barrister. He accepted this offer, was given legal advice and confirmed that he understood the advice given.

He then attended two interviews with the naval police. At the beginning of both interviews he was cautioned (section 76 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984). He declined the opportunity accorded to him to obtain legal advice and to have a legal adviser present at those interviews. He made certain admissions at his first interview and gave the investigators access to his bank accounts. On 27 November 1995 he was interviewed for a second time and then charged.

The charge sheet, as approved by the convening authority listed six charges (pursuant to section 42 of the Naval Discipline Act 1957) of obtaining property and a service by deception contrary to sections 1 and 15 of the Theft Act 1968. All charges related to the making of false representations about travel allowances.

By notice dated 3 July 1996 the convening authority ordered the convening of a court-martial to try the applicant on the charges. He appointed the members of the court-martial by name. All were subordinate to the convening authority but none served within his chain of command. The Judge Advocate was appointed by the Chief Naval Judge Advocate. While the Judge Advocate was subordinate in rank to the President and both served under the Second Sea Lord, there was no command or other substantive institutional link between them.

The court-martial took place on 8-10 July 1996. Once the applicant’s preliminary objections were rejected (he contested the admission of evidence from his interviews and he alleges that he challenged the composition of the court-martial), he pleaded guilty as charged. On 10 July 1996 he was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.

By letter dated 14 January 1997, his legal representative was informed of the decision taken by the Admiralty Board to reject his petition against conviction and sentence. It was considered that his admissions in interview were not the result of oppression and that, given the seriousness of the offences, his sentence was neither manifestly excessive nor wrong in principle.","{'applicant': 'Ian Le Petit', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2004}",001-61815

The case originated in an application (no. 35574/97) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a national of the United Kingdom national, Ian Le Petit (“the applicant”), on 21 March 1997.

The applicant was represented by Mr J. Mackenzie, a lawyer practising in Oxfordshire. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by successive Agents, Mr Eaton, Mr Whomersley and Mr Grainger, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant mainly complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that his naval court-martial did not constitute a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.

The case originated in an application (no. 18308/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Hasan Dikici and Mrs Satike Dikici (“the applicants”), on 1 February 2002.

The applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by Ms A. Bozdoğan, a lawyer practising in İzmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

On 10 May 2007 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).

THE FACTS

The applicants were born in 1949 and 1955 respectively and live in İzmir.

On 3 July 1995 the applicants' son, Ercan Dikici, who was an electrician, had an occupational accident and died from an electric shock.

The same day, the Aliağa Public Prosecutor started an investigation into the incident. Subsequently, on 17 August 1995 he initiated criminal proceedings in the Aliağa Criminal Court against three persons, including the employer of Ercan Dikici and another employee who had been working with him on the day of the accident. They were charged with involuntary manslaughter under Article 455 of the Criminal Code. On 4 July 1996 the Aliağa Criminal Court acquitted the accused persons of the charges against them. On 12 May 1997 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the Aliağa Criminal Court.

On 17 December 1998 the Aliağa Criminal Court found the employer of Ercan Dikici and the other employee who had been working with him guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced them to six months' imprisonment. Their sentence was converted into a fine. On 16 February 2000 the Court of Cassation upheld this judgment.

While the criminal proceedings were pending, on 20 November 1995 the applicants initiated compensation proceedings in the İzmir Labour Court against the employer of their son. They requested 50,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) in respect of pecuniary damage and TRL 1,500,000,000 (approximately 28,000 US Dollars (USD)) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.

On an unspecified date, the İzmir Labour Court adjourned the proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings.

When the criminal proceedings ended, the trial before the İzmir Labour Court resumed. The court ordered further expert reports and heard evidence from witnesses. Subsequently, on 24 May 2001 the court decided to award TRL 600,000,000 to the applicants in respect of non-pecuniary damage with statutory interest running from 3 July 1995. It further found that the applicants had not been in any way financially dependent on their deceased son and therefore rejected their claim for compensation for pecuniary damage.

On 5 July 2001 the Court of Cassation decided that the amount of compensation for non-pecuniary damage should be increased to TRL 1,000,000,000 (approximately USD 790) with statutory interest running from 3 July 19950. Holding that there was no other reason to quash the judgment of the İzmir Labour Court, it rejected the remainder of the applicants' appeal requests. This decision was served on the applicants on 22 August 2001. The same day, the defendant party paid TRL 2,677,533,000 to the applicants (approximately USD 1,850).","{'applicant': 'Hasan Dikici', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2009}",001-95183

The case originated in an application (no. 1942/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr İbrahim Güler (“the applicant”), on 3 December 2007.

The applicant was represented by Ms A. Pamukçu Yördem, a lawyer practising in Diyarbakır. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

On 29 September 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, Mr İbrahim Güler, is a Turkish national who was born in 1973 and is currently serving a prison service in Diyarbakır.

On 5 November 1996 the applicant was taken into police custody during an operation carried out against Hizbullah, an illegal organisation.

On an unspecified date the applicant was questioned in the absence of a lawyer by police officers, who asked him about his affiliation to Hizbullah and events in which he was alleged to have taken part.

On 12 November 1996 the applicant was brought before the Mardin Public Prosecutor. He confirmed the content of his police statements before the prosecutor in the absence of a lawyer.

On the same day, an investigating judge at the Mardin Magistrate’s Court ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention, again in the absence of a lawyer. He accepted the allegations against him and confirmed the statements he had made before the police and the public prosecutor.

According to two reports in the case file, dated 10 and 12 November 1996 respectively, the applicant was medically examined by a doctor who noted that there were no signs of physical violence on the applicant’s body.

By way of an application dated 30 December 1996, the applicant retracted his statements made before the police and the public prosecutor and requested his release from the Diyarbakır Public Prosecutor’s office. He maintained that he had been tortured in police custody and that he had been threatened whilst being taken to the public prosecutor.

On 26 November 1996 the Diyarbakır Public Prosecutor lodged an indictment before the Diyarbakır State Security Court, charging the applicant under Section 146 of the former Turkish Criminal Code with attempting to undermine the constitutional order of the State.

On 28 January 1997 at the first court hearing in the applicant’s case, the applicant retracted his statements made to the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, alleging that they had been made under duress.

State Security Courts were abolished on 16 June 2004 by Law no. 5190. The case was accordingly transferred to the Diyarbakır Assize Court.

Throughout the proceedings, the applicant denied all the accusations against him.

On 31 March 2005 the first-instance court convicted the applicant as charged.

On 11 December 2006 the Court of Cassation quashed the conviction.

On 9 November 2007 the Diyarbakır Assize Court once again convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

On 21 January 2009 the Court of Cassation upheld the conviction.","{'applicant': 'İbrahim Güler', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 53, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2013}",001-126979
15,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 4212/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Ms Sabriye Akıncıbaşı (“the applicant”), on 24 April 2000.

The applicant was represented by Mr K. Yıldırım, a lawyer practising in Marmaris. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

On 19 September 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.

The applicant and the Government each filed further written observations. The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1928 and lives in Marmaris.

In 1984 the applicant concluded a construction contract with Mr G.D. whereby the applicant was to own 40 % of the flats constructed by Mr G.D. on her land.

On 10 July 1985 Mr G.D. and the applicant's legal representative signed an additional contract and decided to sell the flats to Emlak Bank. Subsequently on 29 January 1986 the applicant filed an action with the Ankara Civil Court of First Instance against Mr G.D. She maintained that her legal representative had no right to sign such a contract and accordingly requested the annulment of the contract dated 10 July 1985 and the reimbursement of 132,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL).

On 31 May 1990 the 5th Chamber Ankara Civil Court of First Instance dismissed the case. This judgment was upheld by the Court of Cassation on 19 June 1991. However, upon the request of the applicant, on 26 December 1991 the Court of Cassation rectified its decision of 19 June 1991. The case was accordingly remitted to the first-instance court.

In the meantime, the applicant brought another case against Mr G.D. before the 12th Chamber Ankara Civil Court of First Instance and requested liquidation of partnership. On 26 December 1994 the court ordered Mr G.D. to pay TRL 88,260,073 to the applicant. This judgment became final on 17 May 1996.

On 28 May 1998 the 5th Chamber of the Ankara Civil Court of First Instance ordered Mr G.D. to pay TRL 59,000,000, plus interest at the statutory rate, applicable at the date of the court's decision, running from 29 January 1986. The court dismissed the applicant's request for the payment of a further TRL 63,000,000 since it considered that this amount had already been calculated and included in the case before the 12th Chamber of the Ankara Civil Court of First Instance.

On 10 June 1999 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first‑instance court.

On 1 December 1999 the Court of Cassation dismissed the parties' request for rectification.","{'applicant': 'Sabriye Akıncıbaşı', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2007}",001-83617

The case originated in an application (no. 13146/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Ms Janina Rafińska (“the applicant”), on 1 December 2001.

The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The applicant complained that the length of civil proceedings in her case had exceeded reasonable time.

On 20 June 2006 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of proceedings. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, Ms Janina Rafińska, is a Polish national, who was born in 1937 and lives in Ostrowite.

The applicant and her husband divorced. On 8 July 1994 L. R. (the applicant's husband) lodged a motion with the Rypin District Court for the division of their marital property. He further asked the court to exempt him from court fees.

On 29 July 1994 the court decided to examine the case together with a case concerning the dissolution of the co-ownership of a farm belonging to the applicant, L. R., K. R. (their son) and K. K. Subsequently, on 8 March 1999 the court decided to examine in separate proceedings the case concerning the division of the marital property.

On 7 April 1999 the first hearing in the case was scheduled for 27 April 1999. On the latter date the hearing was adjourned and the parties were requested to submit their requests regarding the evidence to be taken.

18,"PROCEDURE

The present case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 21 May 1985, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention“). The case originated in an application (no. 9697/82) against Ireland lodged with the Commission in 1982 under Article 25 (art. 25) by Roy H.W. Johnston, an Irish citizen, Janice Williams-Johnston, a British citizen, and Nessa Williams-Johnston, their daughter, an Irish citizen.

The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Ireland recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The request sought a decision from the Court as to the existence of violations of Articles 8, 9, 12 and 13 (art. 8, art. 9, art. 12, (art. 13) and of Article 14 (taken in conjunction with Articles 8 and 12 (art. 14+8, art. 14+12)).

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, Roy Johnston and Janice Williams-Johnston stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court, adding that their declaration was to be construed as including their daughter as the third applicant; they also designated the lawyers who would represent them (Rule 30). The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, having been informed by the Registrar of their right to intervene (Article 48, paragraph (b) (art. 48-b), of the Convention and Rule 33 § 3 (b)), did not indicate any intention of so doing.

The Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mr. B. Walsh, the elected judge of Irish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 3 (b)). On 28 June 1985, the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely Mr. W. Ganshof van der Meersch, Mr. J. Cremona, Mr. G. Lagergren, Mr. F. Gölcüklü and Mr. R. Macdonald (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 4) (art. 43).

Mr. Ryssdal, who had assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 5), consulted, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Irish Government (“the Government“), the Commission’s Delegate and the applicants’ representative on the necessity for a written procedure (Rule 37 § 1). Thereafter, in accordance with the Orders and directions of the President of the Chamber, the following documents were lodged at the registry:

on 31 October 1985, applicants’ memorandum setting out their claim under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention;

on 28 November 1985, memorial of the Government and memorial of the applicants. By letter of 31 January 1986, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would present his observations at the hearing.

On 24 January 1986, the Chamber decided under Rule 50 to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court.

After consulting, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government, the Commission’s Delegate and the applicants’ representative, the President directed on 30 January that the oral proceedings should open on 23 June 1986.

The hearings were held in public at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 and 24 June 1986. Immediately before they opened, the Court had held a preparatory meeting. There appeared before the Court:

for the Government Mrs. J. Liddy, Deputy Legal Adviser, Department of Foreign Affairs, Agent, Mr. D. Gleeson, Senior Counsel, Mr. J. O’Reilly, Counsel, Counsel, Mr. M. Russell, Office of the Attorney General, Mr. P. Smyth, Department of Foreign Affairs, Advisers;

for the Commission Mr. Gaukur Jörundsson, Delegate;

for the applicants Senator M. Robinson, Senior Counsel, Dr. W. Duncan, Lecturer in Law, Counsel, Mrs. M. O’Leary, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr. Gleeson and Mr. O’Reilly for the Government, by Mr. Gaukur Jörundsson for the Commission and by Senator Robinson and Dr. Duncan for the applicants, as well as replies to questions put by the Court and one of its members.

Various documents were filed by the Government during the hearings and, at the request of the President of the Court, by the Commission on 16 June and 30 July 1986.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The first applicant is Roy H.W. Johnston, who was born in 1930 and is a scientific research and development manager. He resides at Rathmines, Dublin, with the second applicant, Janice Williams-Johnston, who was born in 1938; she is a school-teacher by profession and used to work as director of a play-group in Dublin, but has been unemployed since 1985. The third applicant is their daughter, Nessa Doreen Williams-Johnston, who was born in 1978.

The first applicant married a Miss M in 1952 in a Church of Ireland ceremony. Three children were born of this marriage, in 1956, 1959 and 1965. In 1965, it became clear to both parties that the marriage had irretrievably broken down and they decided to live separately at different levels in the family house. Several years later both of them, with the other’s knowledge and consent, formed relationships and began to live with third parties. By mutual agreement, the two couples resided in self-contained flats in the house until 1976, when Roy Johnston’s wife moved elsewhere. In 1978, the second applicant, with whom Roy Johnston had been living since 1971, gave birth to Nessa. He consented to his name being included in the Register of Births as the father (see paragraph 26 below).

Under the Constitution of Ireland (see paragraphs 16-17 below), the first applicant is unable to obtain, in Ireland, a dissolution of his marriage to enable him to marry the second applicant. He has taken the following steps to regularise his relationship with her and with his wife and to make proper provision for his dependents. (a) With his wife’s consent, he has consulted solicitors in Dublin and in London as to the possibility of obtaining a dissolution of the marriage outside Ireland. His London solicitors advised that, in the absence of residence within the jurisdiction of the English courts, he would not be able to do so in England, and the matter has therefore not been pursued (see also paragraphs 19-21 below). (b) On 19 September 1982, he concluded a formal separation agreement with his wife, recording an agreement implemented some years earlier. She received a lump-sum of IR£8,800 and provision was made for maintenance of the remaining dependent child of the marriage. The parties also mutually renounced their succession rights over each other’s estates. (c) He has made a will leaving his house to the second applicant for life with remainder over to his four children as tenants in common, one half of the residue of his estate to the second applicant, and the other half to his four children in equal shares. (d) He has supported the third applicant throughout her life and has acted in all respects as a caring father. (e) He contributed towards the maintenance of his wife until the conclusion of the aforementioned separation agreement and has supported the three children of his marriage during their dependency. (f) The second applicant has been nominated as beneficiary under the pension scheme attached to his employment. (g) He has taken out health insurance in the names of the second and third applicants, as members of his family.

The second applicant, who is largely dependent on the first applicant for her support and maintenance, is concerned at the lack of security provided by her present legal status, in particular the absence of any legal right to be maintained by him and of any potential rights of succession in the event of intestacy (see also paragraph 23 below). As is permitted by law, she has adopted the first applicant’s surname, which she uses amongst friends and neighbours, but for business purposes continues to use the name Williams. According to her, she has felt inhibited about telling employers of her domestic circumstances and although she would like to become an Irish citizen by naturalisation, she has been reluctant to make an application, not wishing to put those circumstances in issue.

The third applicant has, under Irish law, the legal situation of an illegitimate child and her parents are concerned at the lack of any means by which she can, even with their consent, be recognised as their child with full rights of support and succession in relation to them (see paragraphs 30-32 below). They are also concerned about the possibility of a stigma attaching to her by virtue of her legal situation, especially when she is attending school.

The first and second applicants state that although they have not practised any formal religion for some time, they have recently joined the Religious Society of Friends (the Quakers) in Dublin. This decision was influenced in part by their concern that the third applicant receives a Christian upbringing.","{'applicant': 'Roy H.W.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The first applicant is Roy H.W. Johnston, who was born in 1930 and is a scientific research and development manager. He resides at Rathmines, Dublin, with the second applicant, Janice Williams-Johnston, who was born in 1938; she is a school-teacher by profession and used to work as director of a play-group in Dublin, but has been unemployed since 1985. The third applicant is their daughter, Nessa Doreen Williams-Johnston, who was born in 1978.

The first applicant married a Miss M in 1952 in a Church of Ireland ceremony. Three children were born of this marriage, in 1956, 1959 and 1965. In 1965, it became clear to both parties that the marriage had irretrievably broken down and they decided to live separately at different levels in the family house. Several years later both of them, with the other’s knowledge and consent, formed relationships and began to live with third parties. By mutual agreement, the two couples resided in self-contained flats in the house until 1976, when Roy Johnston’s wife moved elsewhere. In 1978, the second applicant, with whom Roy Johnston had been living since 1971, gave birth to Nessa. He consented to his name being included in the Register of Births as the father (see paragraph 26 below).

Under the Constitution of Ireland (see paragraphs 16-17 below), the first applicant is unable to obtain, in Ireland, a dissolution of his marriage to enable him to marry the second applicant. He has taken the following steps to regularise his relationship with her and with his wife and to make proper provision for his dependents. (a) With his wife’s consent, he has consulted solicitors in Dublin and in London as to the possibility of obtaining a dissolution of the marriage outside Ireland. His London solicitors advised that, in the absence of residence within the jurisdiction of the English courts, he would not be able to do so in England, and the matter has therefore not been pursued (see also paragraphs 19-21 below). (b) On 19 September 1982, he concluded a formal separation agreement with his wife, recording an agreement implemented some years earlier. She received a lump-sum of IR£8,800 and provision was made for maintenance of the remaining dependent child of the marriage. The parties also mutually renounced their succession rights over each other’s estates. (c) He has made a will leaving his house to the second applicant for life with remainder over to his four children as tenants in common, one half of the residue of his estate to the second applicant, and the other half to his four children in equal shares. (d) He has supported the third applicant throughout her life and has acted in all respects as a caring father. (e) He contributed towards the maintenance of his wife until the conclusion of the aforementioned separation agreement and has supported the three children of his marriage during their dependency. (f) The second applicant has been nominated as beneficiary under the pension scheme attached to his employment. (g) He has taken out health insurance in the names of the second and third applicants, as members of his family.

The second applicant, who is largely dependent on the first applicant for her support and maintenance, is concerned at the lack of security provided by her present legal status, in particular the absence of any legal right to be maintained by him and of any potential rights of succession in the event of intestacy (see also paragraph 23 below). As is permitted by law, she has adopted the first applicant’s surname, which she uses amongst friends and neighbours, but for business purposes continues to use the name Williams. According to her, she has felt inhibited about telling employers of her domestic circumstances and although she would like to become an Irish citizen by naturalisation, she has been reluctant to make an application, not wishing to put those circumstances in issue.

The third applicant has, under Irish law, the legal situation of an illegitimate child and her parents are concerned at the lack of any means by which she can, even with their consent, be recognised as their child with full rights of support and succession in relation to them (see paragraphs 30-32 below). They are also concerned about the possibility of a stigma attaching to her by virtue of her legal situation, especially when she is attending school.

The first and second applicants state that although they have not practised any formal religion for some time, they have recently joined the Religious Society of Friends (the Quakers) in Dublin. This decision was influenced in part by their concern that the third applicant receives a Christian upbringing.","{'applicant': 'Roy H.W.

The present case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 21 May 1985, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention“). The case originated in an application (no. 9697/82) against Ireland lodged with the Commission in 1982 under Article 25 (art. 25) by Roy H.W. Johnston, an Irish citizen, Janice Williams-Johnston, a British citizen, and Nessa Williams-Johnston, their daughter, an Irish citizen.

The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Ireland recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The request sought a decision from the Court as to the existence of violations of Articles 8, 9, 12 and 13 (art. 8, art. 9, art. 12, (art. 13) and of Article 14 (taken in conjunction with Articles 8 and 12 (art. 14+8, art. 14+12)).

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, Roy Johnston and Janice Williams-Johnston stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court, adding that their declaration was to be construed as including their daughter as the third applicant; they also designated the lawyers who would represent them (Rule 30). The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, having been informed by the Registrar of their right to intervene (Article 48, paragraph (b) (art. 48-b), of the Convention and Rule 33 § 3 (b)), did not indicate any intention of so doing.

The Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mr. B. Walsh, the elected judge of Irish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 3 (b)). On 28 June 1985, the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely Mr. W. Ganshof van der Meersch, Mr. J. Cremona, Mr. G. Lagergren, Mr. F. Gölcüklü and Mr. R. Macdonald (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 4) (art. 43).

Mr. Ryssdal, who had assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 5), consulted, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Irish Government (“the Government“), the Commission’s Delegate and the applicants’ representative on the necessity for a written procedure (Rule 37 § 1). Thereafter, in accordance with the Orders and directions of the President of the Chamber, the following documents were lodged at the registry:

on 31 October 1985, applicants’ memorandum setting out their claim under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention;

on 28 November 1985, memorial of the Government and memorial of the applicants. By letter of 31 January 1986, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would present his observations at the hearing.

On 24 January 1986, the Chamber decided under Rule 50 to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court.

After consulting, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government, the Commission’s Delegate and the applicants’ representative, the President directed on 30 January that the oral proceedings should open on 23 June 1986.

The hearings were held in public at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 and 24 June 1986. Immediately before they opened, the Court had held a preparatory meeting. There appeared before the Court:

for the Government Mrs. J. Liddy, Deputy Legal Adviser, Department of Foreign Affairs, Agent, Mr. D. Gleeson, Senior Counsel, Mr. J. O’Reilly, Counsel, Counsel, Mr. M. Russell, Office of the Attorney General, Mr. P. Smyth, Department of Foreign Affairs, Advisers;

for the Commission Mr. Gaukur Jörundsson, Delegate;

for the applicants Senator M. Robinson, Senior Counsel, Dr. W. Duncan, Lecturer in Law, Counsel, Mrs. M. O’Leary, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr. Gleeson and Mr. O’Reilly for the Government, by Mr. Gaukur Jörundsson for the Commission and by Senator Robinson and Dr. Duncan for the applicants, as well as replies to questions put by the Court and one of its members.

Various documents were filed by the Government during the hearings and, at the request of the President of the Court, by the Commission on 16 June and 30 July 1986.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The first applicant is Roy H.W. Johnston, who was born in 1930 and is a scientific research and development manager. He resides at Rathmines, Dublin, with the second applicant, Janice Williams-Johnston, who was born in 1938; she is a school-teacher by profession and used to work as director of a play-group in Dublin, but has been unemployed since 1985. The third applicant is their daughter, Nessa Doreen Williams-Johnston, who was born in 1978.

The first applicant married a Miss M in 1952 in a Church of Ireland ceremony. Three children were born of this marriage, in 1956, 1959 and 1965. In 1965, it became clear to both parties that the marriage had irretrievably broken down and they decided to live separately at different levels in the family house. Several years later both of them, with the other’s knowledge and consent, formed relationships and began to live with third parties. By mutual agreement, the two couples resided in self-contained flats in the house until 1976, when Roy Johnston’s wife moved elsewhere. In 1978, the second applicant, with whom Roy Johnston had been living since 1971, gave birth to Nessa. He consented to his name being included in the Register of Births as the father (see paragraph 26 below).

Under the Constitution of Ireland (see paragraphs 16-17 below), the first applicant is unable to obtain, in Ireland, a dissolution of his marriage to enable him to marry the second applicant. He has taken the following steps to regularise his relationship with her and with his wife and to make proper provision for his dependents.

The parties also mutually renounced their succession rights over each other’s estates. (c) He has made a will leaving his house to the second applicant for life with remainder over to his four children as tenants in common, one half of the residue of his estate to the second applicant, and the other half to his four children in equal shares. (d) He has supported the third applicant throughout her life and has acted in all respects as a caring father. (e) He contributed towards the maintenance of his wife until the conclusion of the aforementioned separation agreement and has supported the three children of his marriage during their dependency. (f) The second applicant has been nominated as beneficiary under the pension scheme attached to his employment. (g) He has taken out health insurance in the names of the second and third applicants, as members of his family.

The first applicant is Roy H.W. Johnston, who was born in 1930 and is a scientific research and development manager. He resides at Rathmines, Dublin, with the second applicant, Janice Williams-Johnston, who was born in 1938; she is a school-teacher by profession and used to work as director of a play-group in Dublin, but has been unemployed since 1985.

The present case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 21 May 1985, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention“). The case originated in an application (no. 9697/82) against Ireland lodged with the Commission in 1982 under Article 25 (art. 25) by Roy H.W. Johnston, an Irish citizen, Janice Williams-Johnston, a British citizen, and Nessa Williams-Johnston, their daughter, an Irish citizen.

The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Ireland recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The request sought a decision from the Court as to the existence of violations of Articles 8, 9, 12 and 13 (art. 8, art. 9, art. 12, (art. 13) and of Article 14 (taken in conjunction with Articles 8 and 12 (art. 14+8, art. 14+12)).

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, Roy Johnston and Janice Williams-Johnston stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court, adding that their declaration was to be construed as including their daughter as the third applicant; they also designated the lawyers who would represent them (Rule 30).

Ganshof van der Meersch, Mr. J. Cremona, Mr. G. Lagergren, Mr. F. Gölcüklü and Mr. R. Macdonald (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 4) (art. 43).

Mr. Ryssdal, who had assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 5), consulted, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Irish Government (“the Government“), the Commission’s Delegate and the applicants’ representative on the necessity for a written procedure (Rule 37 § 1). Thereafter, in accordance with the Orders and directions of the President of the Chamber, the following documents were lodged at the registry:

on 31 October 1985, applicants’ memorandum setting out their claim under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention;

on 28 November 1985, memorial of the Government and memorial of the applicants. By letter of 31 January 1986, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would present his observations at the hearing.

On 24 January 1986, the Chamber decided under Rule 50 to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court.

After consulting, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government, the Commission’s Delegate and the applicants’ representative, the President directed on 30 January that the oral proceedings should open on 23 June 1986.

The hearings were held in public at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 and 24 June 1986. Immediately before they opened, the Court had held a preparatory meeting. There appeared before the Court:

Various documents were filed by the Government during the hearings and, at the request of the President of the Court, by the Commission on 16 June and 30 July 1986.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The first applicant is Roy H.W. Johnston, who was born in 1930 and is a scientific research and development manager. He resides at Rathmines, Dublin, with the second applicant, Janice Williams-Johnston, who was born in 1938; she is a school-teacher by profession and used to work as director of a play-group in Dublin, but has been unemployed since 1985. The third applicant is their daughter, Nessa Doreen Williams-Johnston, who was born in 1978.

The first applicant married a Miss M in 1952 in a Church of Ireland ceremony. Three children were born of this marriage, in 1956, 1959 and 1965. In 1965, it became clear to both parties that the marriage had irretrievably broken down and they decided to live separately at different levels in the family house. Several years later both of them, with the other’s knowledge and consent, formed relationships and began to live with third parties. By mutual agreement, the two couples resided in self-contained flats in the house until 1976, when Roy Johnston’s wife moved elsewhere. In 1978, the second applicant, with whom Roy Johnston had been living since 1971, gave birth to Nessa. He consented to his name being included in the Register of Births as the father (see paragraph 26 below).

Under the Constitution of Ireland (see paragraphs 16-17 below), the first applicant is unable to obtain, in Ireland, a dissolution of his marriage to enable him to marry the second applicant. He has taken the following steps to regularise his relationship with her and with his wife and to make proper provision for his dependents. (a) With his wife’s consent, he has consulted solicitors in Dublin and in London as to the possibility of obtaining a dissolution of the marriage outside Ireland. His London solicitors advised that, in the absence of residence within the jurisdiction of the English courts, he would not be able to do so in England, and the matter has therefore not been pursued (see also paragraphs 19-21 below). (b) On 19 September 1982, he concluded a formal separation agreement with his wife, recording an agreement implemented some years earlier. She received a lump-sum of IR£8,800 and provision was made for maintenance of the remaining dependent child of the marriage. The parties also mutually renounced their succession rights over each other’s estates. (c) He has made a will leaving his house to the second applicant for life with remainder over to his four children as tenants in common, one half of the residue of his estate to the second applicant, and the other half to his four children in equal shares. (d) He has supported the third applicant throughout her life and has acted in all respects as a caring father. (e) He contributed towards the maintenance of his wife until the conclusion of the aforementioned separation agreement and has supported the three children of his marriage during their dependency. (f) The second applicant has been nominated as beneficiary under the pension scheme attached to his employment. (g) He has taken out health insurance in the names of the second and third applicants, as members of his family.

The second applicant, who is largely dependent on the first applicant for her support and maintenance, is concerned at the lack of security provided by her present legal status, in particular the absence of any legal right to be maintained by him and of any potential rights of succession in the event of intestacy (see also paragraph 23 below). As is permitted by law, she has adopted the first applicant’s surname, which she uses amongst friends and neighbours, but for business purposes continues to use the name Williams. According to her, she has felt inhibited about telling employers of her domestic circumstances and although she would like to become an Irish citizen by naturalisation, she has been reluctant to make an application, not wishing to put those circumstances in issue.

The third applicant has, under Irish law, the legal situation of an illegitimate child and her parents are concerned at the lack of any means by which she can, even with their consent, be recognised as their child with full rights of support and succession in relation to them (see paragraphs 30-32 below). They are also concerned about the possibility of a stigma attaching to her by virtue of her legal situation, especially when she is attending school.

The case originated in an application (no. 22341/09) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Somali national, Mr Ilyas Elmi Hode, and a Djibouti national, Ms Hawa Aden Abdi (“the applicants”), on 25 March 2009.

The applicants were represented by Mr I. Thrilling of Harehills and Chapeltown Law Centre, a charitable organisation based in Leeds. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms J. Neenan of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

On 2 June 2009 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The first applicant was born on 13 February 1980 and currently lives in Leeds. The second applicant was born on 15 January 1990 and currently lives in Djibouti.

The first applicant arrived in the United Kingdom on 18 February 2004. He claimed asylum and that claim was accepted in March 2006. Prior to 30 August 2005, successful asylum seekers were granted Indefinite Leave to Remain in the United Kingdom along with refugee status. However, after 30 August 2005 the Immigration Rules were amended and refugees were granted an initial period of 5 years’ Leave to Remain, following which they could apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain. Consequently, the first applicant was granted five years’ leave to remain in the United Kingdom, to expire on 16 March 2011. At the same time, he was provided with a Refugee Convention Travel Document (“CTD”), also to expire on 16 March 2011.

In June 2006 the first applicant was introduced to the second applicant through a friend. In February 2007 he travelled to Djibouti to meet her and they married on 5 April 2007. They lived together in Djibouti until the first applicant returned to the United Kingdom on 15 May 2007.

The second applicant applied for a visa to join the first applicant in the United Kingdom. Although the first applicant was a refugee, the applicants did not qualify for “family reunion” under the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended) (“the Immigration Rules”) because paragraph 352A of the Immigration Rules only applied to spouses who formed part of the refugee’s family unit before he or she left the country of permanent residence. The second applicant therefore applied for leave to enter the United Kingdom under paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules, as the spouse of a person present and settled in the United Kingdom.

On 18 November 2007 the Entry Clearance Officer refused the application on the ground that the first applicant, having only been granted five years’ Leave to Remain, was not a person present and settled in the United Kingdom for the purposes of paragraph 281.

On 17 February 2008 the second applicant gave birth to a son. The first applicant was named as the father on the birth certificate.

The second applicant appealed against the decision to refuse her application for leave to enter. The Immigration Judge accepted that the applicants were married and that the first applicant had sufficient funds to accommodate and maintain his wife and child. He also accepted that the refusal of entry clearance engaged the rights of both applicants under Article 8 of the Convention. He dismissed the appeal, however, holding that the refusal of entry clearance would not interfere disproportionately with the second applicant’s rights under Article 8 of the Convention. In particular, he noted that she had never enjoyed her family life in the United Kingdom and there were no obstacles to prevent the first applicant from living in Djibouti other than that he could not speak French and would be unlikely to secure employment there.

The second applicant applied for reconsideration of the decision. In a decision dated 28 August 2008, the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal refused to order reconsideration. On 24 October 2008 the Administrative Court also dismissed the application for reconsideration.

The first applicant’s leave to remain in the United Kingdom expired on 16 March 2011. He was subsequently granted Indefinite Leave to Remain.

In April 2011 the Immigration Rules were amended to permit refugees to be joined in the United Kingdom by post-flight spouses during their initial period of leave to remain, provided certain other conditions were met.

The second applicant has not re-applied for leave to enter the United Kingdom as the spouse of the first applicant.

The second applicant gave birth to the applicants’ second child on 17 July 2011.","{'applicant': 'Ilyas Elmi Hode', 'articles': [91, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2012}",001-114244

The second applicant therefore applied for leave to enter the United Kingdom under paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules, as the spouse of a person present and settled in the United Kingdom.

On 18 November 2007 the Entry Clearance Officer refused the application on the ground that the first applicant, having only been granted five years’ Leave to Remain, was not a person present and settled in the United Kingdom for the purposes of paragraph 281.

On 17 February 2008 the second applicant gave birth to a son. The first applicant was named as the father on the birth certificate.

The second applicant appealed against the decision to refuse her application for leave to enter. The Immigration Judge accepted that the applicants were married and that the first applicant had sufficient funds to accommodate and maintain his wife and child. He also accepted that the refusal of entry clearance engaged the rights of both applicants under Article 8 of the Convention. He dismissed the appeal, however, holding that the refusal of entry clearance would not interfere disproportionately with the second applicant’s rights under Article 8 of the Convention. In particular, he noted that she had never enjoyed her family life in the United Kingdom and there were no obstacles to prevent the first applicant from living in Djibouti other than that he could not speak French and would be unlikely to secure employment there.

The second applicant applied for reconsideration of the decision. In a decision dated 28 August 2008, the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal refused to order reconsideration. On 24 October 2008 the Administrative Court also dismissed the application for reconsideration.

The first applicant’s leave to remain in the United Kingdom expired on 16 March 2011. He was subsequently granted Indefinite Leave to Remain.

In April 2011 the Immigration Rules were amended to permit refugees to be joined in the United Kingdom by post-flight spouses during their initial period of leave to remain, provided certain other conditions were met.

The second applicant has not re-applied for leave to enter the United Kingdom as the spouse of the first applicant.

The second applicant gave birth to the applicants’ second child on 17 July 2011.","{'applicant': 'Ilyas Elmi Hode', 'articles': [91, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2012}",001-114244

The case originated in an application (no. 22341/09) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Somali national, Mr Ilyas Elmi Hode, and a Djibouti national, Ms Hawa Aden Abdi (“the applicants”), on 25 March 2009.

The applicants were represented by Mr I. Thrilling of Harehills and Chapeltown Law Centre, a charitable organisation based in Leeds. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms J. Neenan of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

On 2 June 2009 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The first applicant was born on 13 February 1980 and currently lives in Leeds. The second applicant was born on 15 January 1990 and currently lives in Djibouti.

The first applicant arrived in the United Kingdom on 18 February 2004. He claimed asylum and that claim was accepted in March 2006. Prior to 30 August 2005, successful asylum seekers were granted Indefinite Leave to Remain in the United Kingdom along with refugee status. However, after 30 August 2005 the Immigration Rules were amended and refugees were granted an initial period of 5 years’ Leave to Remain, following which they could apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain. Consequently, the first applicant was granted five years’ leave to remain in the United Kingdom, to expire on 16 March 2011. At the same time, he was provided with a Refugee Convention Travel Document (“CTD”), also to expire on 16 March 2011.

In June 2006 the first applicant was introduced to the second applicant through a friend. In February 2007 he travelled to Djibouti to meet her and they married on 5 April 2007. They lived together in Djibouti until the first applicant returned to the United Kingdom on 15 May 2007.

The second applicant applied for a visa to join the first applicant in the United Kingdom. Although the first applicant was a refugee, the applicants did not qualify for “family reunion” under the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended) (“the Immigration Rules”) because paragraph 352A of the Immigration Rules only applied to spouses who formed part of the refugee’s family unit before he or she left the country of permanent residence. The second applicant therefore applied for leave to enter the United Kingdom under paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules, as the spouse of a person present and settled in the United Kingdom.

On 18 November 2007 the Entry Clearance Officer refused the application on the ground that the first applicant, having only been granted five years’ Leave to Remain, was not a person present and settled in the United Kingdom for the purposes of paragraph 281.

On 17 February 2008 the second applicant gave birth to a son. The first applicant was named as the father on the birth certificate.

The second applicant appealed against the decision to refuse her application for leave to enter. The Immigration Judge accepted that the applicants were married and that the first applicant had sufficient funds to accommodate and maintain his wife and child.

The case originated in an application (no. 28353/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Aziz Aydın Arslan (“the applicant”), on 23 May 2002.

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

On 19 March 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Istanbul.

In 1988 the applicant was recruited by Türkiye Emlak Bankası A.Ş., a state-owned bank (hereinafter “the Bank”). In 1991 he was appointed to the post of deputy director in charge of credit cards.

On an unspecified date, an investigation was carried out as a result of fraudulent acts in the Topkapı branch of the Bank.

1. The compensation proceedings against the applicant

On 27 January 1994 the Bank brought an action in the 9th Chamber of Istanbul Court of Commerce claiming compensation from the applicant and seven other employees for having caused losses as a result of irregular transactions.

In June 1995 the Bank filed another action in the 4th Chamber of the Istanbul Court of Commerce claiming more compensation.

On an unspecified date, the two actions were joined at the 9th Chamber of Istanbul Court of Commerce.

On 18 November 1999 the 9th Chamber of Istanbul Court of Commerce decided that it had no jurisdiction ratione materiae and that the case fell within the jurisdiction of the labour courts since it concerned a dispute between the employer and employees. This decision was upheld by the Court of Cassation on 10 May 2000.

On 23 October 2001 the Istanbul Labour Court dismissed the action in respect of the applicant and six other employees considering that no fault could be attributed to them. The court however found that the director of the Topkapı branch of the Bank was responsible for the losses in question. It therefore ordered him to pay a certain amount of compensation to the Bank.

2. The criminal proceedings against the Director of the Bank

Meanwhile, criminal proceedings were brought against the director of the Topkapı branch of the Bank and three other persons for having committed a fraud. The applicant and the Bank intervened in these proceedings as a third party. On 9 July 1999 the Bakırköy Assize Court in Istanbul convicted the director and sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment for having abused his duty. It however acquitted the other accused. The applicant appealed against this judgment arguing that the punishment imposed on the director was lenient.

On 29 May 2001 the Court of Cassation quashed the above judgment.

On 31 December 2004 the Bakırköy Assize Court terminated the criminal proceedings against the director since they were time-barred.","{'applicant': 'Aziz Aydın Arslan', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-89991
33,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 70829/01) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Yusuf Gabay, on 16 November 2000.

The applicant was represented by Mrs J. Ertürk, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

On 3 September 2002 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.

On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).

THE FACTS

The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Istanbul.

On an unspecified date, the applicant lodged a set of enforcement proceedings against his debtors in order to enforce the payment of six bonds issued by his debtors between 1980 and 1981. The enforcement proceedings lasted for almost ten years. In 1993 the applicant was paid a sum of 54,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL), interest included.

On 25 January 1994 the applicant brought an action before the Istanbul Commercial Court against his debtors and requested an additional compensation under Article 105 of the Code of Obligations, for the damage he sustained as a result of the delay in payment. He alleged that the payment was made with ten years of delay and that his loss resulting from the increase in inflation during this period exceeded the interest awarded to him for late payment.

On 17 April 1995 an expert report was submitted to the court. The expert report stated that the applicant should not be awarded additional compensation on the ground that he was unable to substantiate the damages he sustained against inflation.

On 5 October 1995 the Istanbul Commercial Court dismissed the applicant’s request for the reasons stated in the expert’s report. The applicant appealed.

On 24 December 1996 the Court of Cassation quashed the first- instance court’s decision on the ground that the applicant had sustained damages due to the delay in payment and that he should be awarded compensation. The case was remitted to the first instance court.

On 29 September 1997 the first-instance court adhered to its first decision. The applicant appealed.

On 3 November 1999 the Joint Civil Chambers of the Court of Cassation upheld the first-instance court’s decision. The applicant’s request for rectification was dismissed on 24 April 2000. This decision was served on the applicant on 24 May 2000.","{'applicant': 'Yusuf Gabay', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 50, 57, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2005}",001-70759

The case originated in an application (no. 56745/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr Wayne Thomas Black (“the applicant”), on 1 December 1999.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr S. Creighton, a lawyer practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mr C.A. Whomersley and, subsequently, Mr J. Grainger, both of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 about his adjudication proceedings pointing to the role of the Governor and the lack of a public pronouncement of the decision. He also invoked Article 6 § 3(c) as regards the lack of legal representation.

By a decision of 27 September 2005, a Chamber of the Fourth Section of the Court declared the application partly admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed further written observations (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1967 and is currently in prison in HMP Longmartin.

On 26 July 1995 the applicant was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment for armed robbery. On 8 January 1996 he was sentenced to consecutive sentences of 3 years’ imprisonment for escaping lawful custody and of one year for assault. He was eligible for consideration for release on parole on licence on 5 September 2006 and qualifies for automatic release on licence on 5 September 2010.

On 29 May 1997 he was escorted to the searching area for high risk prisoners following a prison visit. Two officers conducted the strip search. During that search an item fell from the applicant’s anus. The applicant immediately picked it up and re-inserted it into his anus. The officers then ordered the applicant to hand over the object. The applicant refused, stating “I cannot do that”. He was charged with disobeying a lawful order contrary to Rule 47(19) of the Prison Rules 1964 (applicable at the relevant time).

On 31 May 1997 the hearing of the charge before the prison Governor commenced and the applicant was granted an adjournment to obtain legal advice. On 10 June 1997 he applied to the Governor for legal representation at the hearing. The hearing re-commenced on 12 June 1997. The request for legal representation was refused by the Governor.

The applicant’s defence was that the item was a suppository. Evidence was adduced that no suppositories had been prescribed to the applicant in the 2 years prior to the incident and that the applicant had not complied with the officers’ order. He was found guilty as charged. He was awarded 5 additional days’ detention together with exclusion from work and forfeiture of privileges for 10 days.

The applicant applied to the Home Office to have the Governor’s ruling quashed on the basis that he could not have handed over the item as it had already been re-inserted in his anal area. His application was rejected on 1 August 1997. He then complained to the Prisons Ombudsman who gave his opinion and recommendation on 9 August 1997. He was not persuaded that the adjudication had properly investigated the sequence of events during the search: if it was the case that the applicant had already re-inserted the item when he was asked for it, the prison officer’s request to retrieve it may not have been lawful. He recommended that the Governor’s finding be quashed. By letter dated 5 January 1998 the prison service confirmed that the Prisons Ombudsman’s recommendation had not been accepted.

On 17 April 1998 the applicant applied for leave to apply for judicial review of the decision of the Governor. A hearing took place in the High Court on 21 June 1999. The prison service submitted that effective drugs’ control in prison required that they had to have the power to conduct strip searches including making a request to remove items suspected of being secreted internally. The applicant provided medical evidence to the effect that such removal risked causing harm to him. The High Court rejected the application finding, inter alia, that, depending as it does on the circumstances of the case, an order to a prisoner to remove an item from his anus would not necessarily be unlawful. The applicant did not appeal.","{'applicant': 'Wayne Thomas Black', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2007}",001-79012

By a decision of 27 September 2005, a Chamber of the Fourth Section of the Court declared the application partly admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed further written observations (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1967 and is currently in prison in HMP Longmartin.

On 26 July 1995 the applicant was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment for armed robbery. On 8 January 1996 he was sentenced to consecutive sentences of 3 years’ imprisonment for escaping lawful custody and of one year for assault. He was eligible for consideration for release on parole on licence on 5 September 2006 and qualifies for automatic release on licence on 5 September 2010.

On 29 May 1997 he was escorted to the searching area for high risk prisoners following a prison visit. Two officers conducted the strip search. During that search an item fell from the applicant’s anus. The applicant immediately picked it up and re-inserted it into his anus. The officers then ordered the applicant to hand over the object. The applicant refused, stating “I cannot do that”. He was charged with disobeying a lawful order contrary to Rule 47(19) of the Prison Rules 1964 (applicable at the relevant time).

On 31 May 1997 the hearing of the charge before the prison Governor commenced and the applicant was granted an adjournment to obtain legal advice. On 10 June 1997 he applied to the Governor for legal representation at the hearing. The hearing re-commenced on 12 June 1997. The request for legal representation was refused by the Governor.

The applicant’s defence was that the item was a suppository. Evidence was adduced that no suppositories had been prescribed to the applicant in the 2 years prior to the incident and that the applicant had not complied with the officers’ order. He was found guilty as charged. He was awarded 5 additional days’ detention together with exclusion from work and forfeiture of privileges for 10 days.

The applicant applied to the Home Office to have the Governor’s ruling quashed on the basis that he could not have handed over the item as it had already been re-inserted in his anal area. His application was rejected on 1 August 1997. He then complained to the Prisons Ombudsman who gave his opinion and recommendation on 9 August 1997. He was not persuaded that the adjudication had properly investigated the sequence of events during the search: if it was the case that the applicant had already re-inserted the item when he was asked for it, the prison officer’s request to retrieve it may not have been lawful. He recommended that the Governor’s finding be quashed. By letter dated 5 January 1998 the prison service confirmed that the Prisons Ombudsman’s recommendation had not been accepted.

On 17 April 1998 the applicant applied for leave to apply for judicial review of the decision of the Governor. A hearing took place in the High Court on 21 June 1999. The prison service submitted that effective drugs’ control in prison required that they had to have the power to conduct strip searches including making a request to remove items suspected of being secreted internally. The applicant provided medical evidence to the effect that such removal risked causing harm to him. The High Court rejected the application finding, inter alia, that, depending as it does on the circumstances of the case, an order to a prisoner to remove an item from his anus would not necessarily be unlawful. The applicant did not appeal.","{'applicant': 'Wayne Thomas Black', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2007}",001-79012

The case originated in an application (no. 13378/05) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two British nationals, Ms J.M. Burden and Ms S.D. Burden (“the applicants”), on 29 March 2005.

The applicants were represented by Ms E. Gedye of Wood, Awdry and Ford, a solicitor practising in Chippenham. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Grainger of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicants complained under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that, when the first of them died, the survivor would be required to pay inheritance tax on the dead sister’s share of the family home, whereas the survivor of a married couple or a homosexual relationship registered under the Civil Partnership Act 2004 would be exempt from paying inheritance tax in these circumstances.

The application was allocated to a Chamber within the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court), composed of Josep Casadevall, Nicolas Bratza, Giovanni Bonello, Kristaq Traja, Stanislav Pavlovschi, Lech Garlicki and Lijiljana Mijović, judges, and Lawrence Early, Section Registrar. On 30 June 2005 the Chamber President decided to give the case priority under Rule 41 and that the admissibility and merits should be examined jointly, in accordance with Article 29 § 3 of the Convention and Rule 54A. On 12 December 2006 the Chamber unanimously declared the application admissible and delivered a judgment in which it held, by four votes to three, that there had been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

On 23 May 2007, pursuant to a request by the applicants dated 8 March 2007, the panel of the Grand Chamber decided to refer the case to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention.

The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 27 §§ 2 and 3 of the Convention and Rule 24.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations. In addition, third-party comments were received from the Belgian and Irish Governments on 28 August 2007.

A hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 12 September 2007 (Rule 59 § 3). There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Ms H. Mulvein, Agent, Mr J. Crow, Counsel, Mr J. Couchman, Ms K. Innes, Mr S. Gocke, Mr R. Linham, Advisers; (b) for the applicants Mr D. Pannick QC, Mr S. Grodzinksi, Counsel, Ms E. Gedye, Ms E. Stradling, Solicitors. The Court heard addresses by Mr Pannick and Mr Crow, as well as their answers to questions put by Judge Zupančič.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.

The applicants are unmarried sisters, born on 26 May 1918 and 2 December 1925 respectively. They have lived together, in a stable, committed and mutually supportive relationship, all their lives; for the last thirty-one years in a house built on land inherited from their parents in Wiltshire.

The house is owned by the applicants in their joint names. According to an expert valuation dated 12 January 2006, the property was worth 425,000 pounds sterling (GBP), or GBP 550,000 if sold together with the adjoining land. The sisters also jointly own two other properties, worth GBP 325,000 in total. In addition, each sister owns in her sole name shares and other investments worth approximately GBP 150,000. Each has made a will leaving all her property to the other.

The applicants submitted that the value of their jointly owned property had increased to the point that each sister’s one-half share was worth significantly more than the current exemption threshold for inheritance tax (see paragraph 13 below).","{'applicant': 'J.M.

The application was allocated to a Chamber within the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court), composed of Josep Casadevall, Nicolas Bratza, Giovanni Bonello, Kristaq Traja, Stanislav Pavlovschi, Lech Garlicki and Lijiljana Mijović, judges, and Lawrence Early, Section Registrar. On 30 June 2005 the Chamber President decided to give the case priority under Rule 41 and that the admissibility and merits should be examined jointly, in accordance with Article 29 § 3 of the Convention and Rule 54A. On 12 December 2006 the Chamber unanimously declared the application admissible and delivered a judgment in which it held, by four votes to three, that there had been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

On 23 May 2007, pursuant to a request by the applicants dated 8 March 2007, the panel of the Grand Chamber decided to refer the case to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention.

The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 27 §§ 2 and 3 of the Convention and Rule 24.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations. In addition, third-party comments were received from the Belgian and Irish Governments on 28 August 2007.

A hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 12 September 2007 (Rule 59 § 3). There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Ms H. Mulvein, Agent, Mr J. Crow, Counsel, Mr J. Couchman, Ms K. Innes, Mr S. Gocke, Mr R. Linham, Advisers; (b) for the applicants Mr D. Pannick QC, Mr S. Grodzinksi, Counsel, Ms E. Gedye, Ms E. Stradling, Solicitors.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.

The applicants are unmarried sisters, born on 26 May 1918 and 2 December 1925 respectively. They have lived together, in a stable, committed and mutually supportive relationship, all their lives; for the last thirty-one years in a house built on land inherited from their parents in Wiltshire.

The house is owned by the applicants in their joint names. According to an expert valuation dated 12 January 2006, the property was worth 425,000 pounds sterling (GBP), or GBP 550,000 if sold together with the adjoining land. The sisters also jointly own two other properties, worth GBP 325,000 in total. In addition, each sister owns in her sole name shares and other investments worth approximately GBP 150,000. Each has made a will leaving all her property to the other.

The applicants submitted that the value of their jointly owned property had increased to the point that each sister’s one-half share was worth significantly more than the current exemption threshold for inheritance tax (see paragraph 13 below).","{'applicant': 'J.M.

The case originated in an application (no. 1813/07) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Swedish nationals, Mr Tor Fredrik Vejdeland, Mr Mattias Harlin, Mr Björn Täng and Mr Niklas Lundström (“the applicants”), on 4 January 2007.

The applicants were represented by Mr N. Uggla, a lawyer practising in Stockholm. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs A. Erman, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

The applicants alleged that the Supreme Court judgment of 6 July 2006 constituted a violation of their freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention. They further submitted that they were punished without law in violation of Article 7 of the Convention.

On 27 November 2008 the President of the Third Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government.

The application was later transferred to the Fifth Section of the Court, following the re-composition of the Court’s sections on 1 February 2011. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).

In addition to written observations by the applicants and the Government, third-party comments were received jointly from the International Centre for the Legal Protection of Human Rights and the International Commission of Jurists, whom the President had authorised to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicants were born in 1978, 1981, 1987 and 1986 respectively. The first applicant lives in Gothenburg and the other applicants live in Sundsvall.

In December 2004 the applicants, together with three other persons, went to an upper secondary school (gymnasieskola) and distributed approximately a hundred leaflets by leaving them in or on the pupils’ lockers. The episode ended when the school’s principal intervened and made them leave the premises. The originator of the leaflets was an organisation called National Youth and the leaflets contained, inter alia, the following statements: “Homosexual Propaganda (Homosexpropaganda) In the course of a few decades society has swung from rejection of homosexuality and other sexual deviances (avarter) to embracing this deviant sexual proclivity (böjelse). Your anti-Swedish teachers know very well that homosexuality has a morally destructive effect on the substance of society (folkkroppen) and will willingly try to put it forward as something normal and good. -- Tell them that HIV and AIDS appeared early with the homosexuals and that their promiscuous lifestyle was one of the main reasons for this modern-day plague gaining a foothold. -- Tell them that homosexual lobby organisations are also trying to play down (avdramatisera) paedophilia, and ask if this sexual deviation (sexuella avart) should be legalised.”

For distributing the leaflets, the applicants were charged with agitation against a national or ethnic group (hets mot folkgrupp).

The applicants disputed that the text in the leaflets expressed contempt for homosexuals and claimed that, in any event, they had not intended to express contempt for homosexuals as a group. They stated that the purpose of their activity had been to start a debate about the lack of objectivity in the education dispensed in Swedish schools.

On 11 July 2005 the District Court (tingsrätten) of Bollnäs found that the statements in the leaflets had clearly gone beyond what could be considered an objective discussion of homosexuals as a group and that the applicants’ intention had been to express contempt for homosexuals. It therefore convicted the applicants of agitation against a national or ethnic group, and sentenced the first and second applicants to two months’ imprisonment, the third applicant to a suspended sentence (villkorlig dom) combined with a fine, and the fourth applicant to probation (skyddstillsyn) combined with 40 hours of community service.

The applicants as well as the prosecutor appealed against the judgment to the Court of Appeal (hovrätten) for Southern Norrland. The applicants requested the court to reject the charges, to consider the criminal act minor, or at least to reduce the punishments. The prosecutor appealed as regards the first three applicants, requesting the court to consider the criminal act to be aggravated or at least to increase the punishments.

On 14 December 2005 the Court of Appeal, referring to the Supreme Court’s judgment of 29 November 2005 in the case NJA 2005 p. 805 (see below under “Relevant domestic law and practice”), rejected the charges against the applicants on the ground that a conviction would amount to a violation of their right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by the Convention.

The Office of the Prosecutor-General (Riksåklagaren) appealed against the judgment to the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen) and requested it to convict the applicants of agitation against a national or ethnic group, arguing that it would not amount to a violation of Article 10 of the Convention in the circumstances of the present case. The applicants disputed the appeal.

On 6 July 2006 the Supreme Court convicted the applicants of agitation against a national or ethnic group. The majority of judges (three out of five) first considered decisive for the outcome of the case whether the interference with the applicants’ freedom to distribute the leaflets could be considered necessary in a democratic society and whether the interference with their freedom of expression could be deemed proportionate to the aim of protecting the group of homosexuals from the violation that the content of the leaflets constituted. The majority then held: “In the light of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights regarding Article 10, in the interpretation of the expression “contempt” in the provision regarding incitement against a group, a comprehensive assessment of the circumstances of the case should be made, where, in particular, the following should be considered. The handing out of the leaflets took place at a school. The accused did not have free access to the premises, which can be considered a relatively sheltered environment as regards the political actions of outsiders. The placement of the leaflets in and on the pupils’ lockers meant that the young people received them without having the possibility to decide whether they wanted to accept them or not. The purpose of the handing out of the leaflets was indeed to initiate a debate between pupils and teachers on a question of public interest, namely the objectivity of the education in Swedish schools, and to supply the pupils with arguments. However, these were formulated in a way that was offensive and disparaging for homosexuals as a group and in violation of the duty under Article 10 to avoid as far as possible statements that are unwarrantably offensive to others thus constituting an assault on their rights, and without contributing to any form of public debate which could help to further mutual understanding. The purpose of the relevant sections in the leaflets could have been achieved without statements that were offensive to homosexuals as a group. Thus, the situation was in part different from that in NJA 2005 p. 805, where a pastor made his statements before his congregation in a sermon based on certain biblical quotations. The above-mentioned reasons taken together lead to the conclusion that Chapter 16, Article 8 of the Penal Code, interpreted in conformity with the Convention, permits a judgment of conviction, given the present circumstances of this case.”

The minority (two judges) found that convicting the applicants would not be proportionate to the aims pursued and would therefore be in violation of Article 10 of the Convention. Hence, the minority wanted to acquit the applicants but gave separate reasons for this conclusion, at least in part. One of them was of the view that the prosecution was not formulated in such a way that the Supreme Court could take into consideration that the leaflets had been distributed at a school and addressed to the pupils, while the other found it natural that the leaflets had been aimed at pupils and agreed with the majority that an overall assessment of the circumstances had to be made.

The first three applicants were given suspended sentences combined with fines ranging from SEK 1,800 (approximately 200 euros (EUR)) to SEK 19,000 (approximately EUR 2,000) and the fourth applicant was sentenced to probation.","{'applicant': 'Tor Fredrik Vejdeland', 'articles': [91, 34, 51, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 48, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2012}",001-109046

The originator of the leaflets was an organisation called National Youth and the leaflets contained, inter alia, the following statements: “Homosexual Propaganda (Homosexpropaganda) In the course of a few decades society has swung from rejection of homosexuality and other sexual deviances (avarter) to embracing this deviant sexual proclivity (böjelse). Your anti-Swedish teachers know very well that homosexuality has a morally destructive effect on the substance of society (folkkroppen) and will willingly try to put it forward as something normal and good. -- Tell them that HIV and AIDS appeared early with the homosexuals and that their promiscuous lifestyle was one of the main reasons for this modern-day plague gaining a foothold. -- Tell them that homosexual lobby organisations are also trying to play down (avdramatisera) paedophilia, and ask if this sexual deviation (sexuella avart) should be legalised.”

For distributing the leaflets, the applicants were charged with agitation against a national or ethnic group (hets mot folkgrupp).

The applicants disputed that the text in the leaflets expressed contempt for homosexuals and claimed that, in any event, they had not intended to express contempt for homosexuals as a group. They stated that the purpose of their activity had been to start a debate about the lack of objectivity in the education dispensed in Swedish schools.

On 11 July 2005 the District Court (tingsrätten) of Bollnäs found that the statements in the leaflets had clearly gone beyond what could be considered an objective discussion of homosexuals as a group and that the applicants’ intention had been to express contempt for homosexuals. It therefore convicted the applicants of agitation against a national or ethnic group, and sentenced the first and second applicants to two months’ imprisonment, the third applicant to a suspended sentence (villkorlig dom) combined with a fine, and the fourth applicant to probation (skyddstillsyn) combined with 40 hours of community service.

The applicants as well as the prosecutor appealed against the judgment to the Court of Appeal (hovrätten) for Southern Norrland. The applicants requested the court to reject the charges, to consider the criminal act minor, or at least to reduce the punishments. The prosecutor appealed as regards the first three applicants, requesting the court to consider the criminal act to be aggravated or at least to increase the punishments.

On 14 December 2005 the Court of Appeal, referring to the Supreme Court’s judgment of 29 November 2005 in the case NJA 2005 p. 805 (see below under “Relevant domestic law and practice”), rejected the charges against the applicants on the ground that a conviction would amount to a violation of their right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by the Convention.

The Office of the Prosecutor-General (Riksåklagaren) appealed against the judgment to the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen) and requested it to convict the applicants of agitation against a national or ethnic group, arguing that it would not amount to a violation of Article 10 of the Convention in the circumstances of the present case. The applicants disputed the appeal.

On 6 July 2006 the Supreme Court convicted the applicants of agitation against a national or ethnic group. The majority of judges (three out of five) first considered decisive for the outcome of the case whether the interference with the applicants’ freedom to distribute the leaflets could be considered necessary in a democratic society and whether the interference with their freedom of expression could be deemed proportionate to the aim of protecting the group of homosexuals from the violation that the content of the leaflets constituted. The majority then held: “In the light of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights regarding Article 10, in the interpretation of the expression “contempt” in the provision regarding incitement against a group, a comprehensive assessment of the circumstances of the case should be made, where, in particular, the following should be considered. The handing out of the leaflets took place at a school. The accused did not have free access to the premises, which can be considered a relatively sheltered environment as regards the political actions of outsiders. The placement of the leaflets in and on the pupils’ lockers meant that the young people received them without having the possibility to decide whether they wanted to accept them or not. The purpose of the handing out of the leaflets was indeed to initiate a debate between pupils and teachers on a question of public interest, namely the objectivity of the education in Swedish schools, and to supply the pupils with arguments. However, these were formulated in a way that was offensive and disparaging for homosexuals as a group and in violation of the duty under Article 10 to avoid as far as possible statements that are unwarrantably offensive to others thus constituting an assault on their rights, and without contributing to any form of public debate which could help to further mutual understanding. The purpose of the relevant sections in the leaflets could have been achieved without statements that were offensive to homosexuals as a group. Thus, the situation was in part different from that in NJA 2005 p. 805, where a pastor made his statements before his congregation in a sermon based on certain biblical quotations. The above-mentioned reasons taken together lead to the conclusion that Chapter 16, Article 8 of the Penal Code, interpreted in conformity with the Convention, permits a judgment of conviction, given the present circumstances of this case.”

The minority (two judges) found that convicting the applicants would not be proportionate to the aims pursued and would therefore be in violation of Article 10 of the Convention. Hence, the minority wanted to acquit the applicants but gave separate reasons for this conclusion, at least in part. One of them was of the view that the prosecution was not formulated in such a way that the Supreme Court could take into consideration that the leaflets had been distributed at a school and addressed to the pupils, while the other found it natural that the leaflets had been aimed at pupils and agreed with the majority that an overall assessment of the circumstances had to be made.

The first three applicants were given suspended sentences combined with fines ranging from SEK 1,800 (approximately 200 euros (EUR)) to SEK 19,000 (approximately EUR 2,000) and the fourth applicant was sentenced to probation.","{'applicant': 'Tor Fredrik Vejdeland', 'articles': [91, 34, 51, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 48, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2012}",001-109046

The case originated in an application (no. 1813/07) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Swedish nationals, Mr Tor Fredrik Vejdeland, Mr Mattias Harlin, Mr Björn Täng and Mr Niklas Lundström (“the applicants”), on 4 January 2007.

The applicants were represented by Mr N. Uggla, a lawyer practising in Stockholm. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs A. Erman, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

The applicants alleged that the Supreme Court judgment of 6 July 2006 constituted a violation of their freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention. They further submitted that they were punished without law in violation of Article 7 of the Convention.

On 27 November 2008 the President of the Third Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government.

The application was later transferred to the Fifth Section of the Court, following the re-composition of the Court’s sections on 1 February 2011. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).

In addition to written observations by the applicants and the Government, third-party comments were received jointly from the International Centre for the Legal Protection of Human Rights and the International Commission of Jurists, whom the President had authorised to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention).

It therefore convicted the applicants of agitation against a national or ethnic group, and sentenced the first and second applicants to two months’ imprisonment, the third applicant to a suspended sentence (villkorlig dom) combined with a fine, and the fourth applicant to probation (skyddstillsyn) combined with 40 hours of community service.

The applicants as well as the prosecutor appealed against the judgment to the Court of Appeal (hovrätten) for Southern Norrland. The applicants requested the court to reject the charges, to consider the criminal act minor, or at least to reduce the punishments. The prosecutor appealed as regards the first three applicants, requesting the court to consider the criminal act to be aggravated or at least to increase the punishments.

On 14 December 2005 the Court of Appeal, referring to the Supreme Court’s judgment of 29 November 2005 in the case NJA 2005 p. 805 (see below under “Relevant domestic law and practice”), rejected the charges against the applicants on the ground that a conviction would amount to a violation of their right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by the Convention.

The Office of the Prosecutor-General (Riksåklagaren) appealed against the judgment to the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen) and requested it to convict the applicants of agitation against a national or ethnic group, arguing that it would not amount to a violation of Article 10 of the Convention in the circumstances of the present case. The applicants disputed the appeal.

On 6 July 2006 the Supreme Court convicted the applicants of agitation against a national or ethnic group. The majority of judges (three out of five) first considered decisive for the outcome of the case whether the interference with the applicants’ freedom to distribute the leaflets could be considered necessary in a democratic society and whether the interference with their freedom of expression could be deemed proportionate to the aim of protecting the group of homosexuals from the violation that the content of the leaflets constituted. The majority then held: “In the light of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights regarding Article 10, in the interpretation of the expression “contempt” in the provision regarding incitement against a group, a comprehensive assessment of the circumstances of the case should be made, where, in particular, the following should be considered. The handing out of the leaflets took place at a school. The accused did not have free access to the premises, which can be considered a relatively sheltered environment as regards the political actions of outsiders. The placement of the leaflets in and on the pupils’ lockers meant that the young people received them without having the possibility to decide whether they wanted to accept them or not. The purpose of the handing out of the leaflets was indeed to initiate a debate between pupils and teachers on a question of public interest, namely the objectivity of the education in Swedish schools, and to supply the pupils with arguments. However, these were formulated in a way that was offensive and disparaging for homosexuals as a group and in violation of the duty under Article 10 to avoid as far as possible statements that are unwarrantably offensive to others thus constituting an assault on their rights, and without contributing to any form of public debate which could help to further mutual understanding. The purpose of the relevant sections in the leaflets could have been achieved without statements that were offensive to homosexuals as a group. Thus, the situation was in part different from that in NJA 2005 p. 805, where a pastor made his statements before his congregation in a sermon based on certain biblical quotations. The above-mentioned reasons taken together lead to the conclusion that Chapter 16, Article 8 of the Penal Code, interpreted in conformity with the Convention, permits a judgment of conviction, given the present circumstances of this case.”

The minority (two judges) found that convicting the applicants would not be proportionate to the aims pursued and would therefore be in violation of Article 10 of the Convention. Hence, the minority wanted to acquit the applicants but gave separate reasons for this conclusion, at least in part. One of them was of the view that the prosecution was not formulated in such a way that the Supreme Court could take into consideration that the leaflets had been distributed at a school and addressed to the pupils, while the other found it natural that the leaflets had been aimed at pupils and agreed with the majority that an overall assessment of the circumstances had to be made.

The first three applicants were given suspended sentences combined with fines ranging from SEK 1,800 (approximately 200 euros (EUR)) to SEK 19,000 (approximately EUR 2,000) and the fourth applicant was sentenced to probation.","{'applicant': 'Tor Fredrik Vejdeland', 'articles': [91, 34, 51, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 48, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2012}",001-109046
56,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 41902/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Turkish nationals, Mr Aziz Bakırcı, Ms Zekiye Çirkinoğlu (Bakırcı), Mr Sabri Bakırcı and Ms Laetitia Cardier (Sabiha) Bakırcı (“the applicants”), on 8 September 2004.

The applicants were represented by Mr Hakan Bakırcıoğlu and Mr Erkan Bakırcıoğlu, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

On 16 June 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicants were born in 1951, 1950, 1964 and 1962 respectively. The first three applicants live in Turkey and the fourth applicant lives in France.

The application concerns a dispute between the applicants and a third party over ownership of plots of land in the province of Adıyaman.

A. Proceedings before the Kahta Civil Court of First Instance

On 21 February 1980 the applicants brought an action before the Kahta Civil Court of First Instance for prohibition of the third party's unlawful occupation of their land. On 16 April 1997 the civil court issued a decision of lack of subject-matter jurisdiction (görevsizlik kararı) and sent the case file to the Kahta Cadastral Court.

B. Proceedings before the Kahta Cadastral Court

In the meantime, on 8 April 1997 the third party brought a counter action against the applicants before the Kahta Cadastral Court and requested registration of the plots of land in his name.

On 14 April 1997 the General Directorate of Forests in Turkey (“the Directorate”) also brought an action before the same court and requested that one of the plots owned by one of the applicants should be designated as forest and registered as property of the Treasury. The Kahta court joined the cases on 2 September 1997.

On 6 July 2000 the Kahta Cadastral Court ordered partial registration of the land in the names of the applicants. The applicants and the Directorate appealed. On 29 January 2001 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment, holding that all the land had to be registered in the name of the applicants and remitted the case to the Kahta Cadastral Court.

On 17 April 2003 the Kahta Cadastral Court abided by the Court of Cassation's decision and ordered the registration of the land in the name of the applicants.

On 15 December 2003 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment and on 13 July 2004 it dismissed the third party's rectification request.","{'applicant': 'Aziz Bakırcı', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2009}",001-94981
57,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 42317/98) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Ivan Hooper (“the applicant”), on 16 July 1998.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr Burgess, a solicitor practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Emily Wilmott of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant alleged that neither he nor his legal representative were given the opportunity to address the magistrates' court prior to the imposition of a binding over order in respect of which he was later committed to prison for failure to comply with its terms.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

By a decision of 21 October 2003, the Court declared the application partly admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

On 3 January 1997 the applicant appeared before the magistrates' court, charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and failing to answer bail. He was legally represented. The applicant elected to be tried in the Crown Court. The stipendiary magistrate therefore adjourned the proceedings to enable a committal hearing to take place at a later date and proceeded to consider whether the applicant should be granted bail. During the course of that consideration, the applicant “reacted adversely” in court, causing a disturbance which led the magistrate to conclude that there existed a future risk of a breach of the peace by him. The magistrate therefore made an order binding the applicant over to keep the peace and to be of good behaviour under the Justices of the Peace Act 1361.

The applicant was “bound over” in his own recognisance of 50 pounds sterling (GBP) together with a surety of GBP 250. The precise terms of the order were found by the Divisional Court (in the later judicial review proceedings) to be unclear. However, the Divisional Court proceeded on the assumption that the order of the magistrates' court had fixed a period of 28 days' imprisonment in default of the applicant's own recognisance and/or a suitable surety. The magistrate did not give any opportunity for the applicant or his representative to make submissions about the terms of the order before it was imposed.

It appears that later on the day on which the binding over order was imposed, in the absence of both the applicant and his representative, the surety presented himself to the magistrate, who himself took the recognisance. The magistrate appears to have deemed the proposed surety unsuitable and to have done so on the ground that he did not have any readily available money. The applicant was committed to custody on the same day for 28 days. The Divisional Court later noted that he had remained in custody until 16 January 1997 or a little later.

On 2 June 1997 the applicant was granted leave to apply for judicial review of the decision to impose the binding over order.

On 20 January 1998 the Divisional Court granted the application for judicial review. The nature of the applicant's case was stated by the Divisional Court to be as follows: “It is not suggested by Mr. Daniel, for the applicant, that the magistrate had no power under [the Justices of the Peace Act 1361] or common law to impose a binding over order without consent, to require a surety or to impose a sentence of imprisonment in lieu. What is suggested is that there was a breach of natural justice or procedural irregularity in the way in which the magistrate dealt with the matter, without investigating further, or giving specific opportunity to the applicant or his legal representative to make representations about the terms of any binding over order.”

The Divisional Court (Lord Justice Simon Brown and Mr Justice Mance) agreed that the binding over order had been procedurally irregular and granted a declaration to that effect. During the course of their judgments, the judges of the Divisional Court held that: (a) previous domestic case-law had established that there were circumstances where failing to hear a defendant or his representative prior to imposing a binding over order containing a requirement of a recognisance could amount to a breach of the rules of natural justice. Mr Justice Mance quoted, inter alia, the headnote of the case of R. v. Central Criminal Court ex parte Boulding [1984] 1 QB 813 that: “... although there was no general obligation upon a court to afford a defendant an opportunity to be heard prior to binding him over, it was a breach of the rules of natural justice, unless the recognisance was of a trivial sum, for a court to bind a person over without inquiring into his means and giving him an opportunity to make representations as to the size of the recognisance.” (b) the position where there was a requirement for a surety was even clearer. A surety required the separate approval of the court as to his suitability. This was outside the control of the person to be bound over and yet could have drastic consequences for him where, as in the present case, it resulted in his serving a period of imprisonment imposed as an alternative; (c) in such circumstances, magistrates needed to take particular care lest, in effect, they imposed a binding order which amounted to an automatic sentence of imprisonment without appreciating what they were doing; (d) a defendant ought not to be put at peril of a prison sentence in default of finding a surety unless he had first been specifically invited to address the magistrates' court upon that point; (e) the magistrate did not expressly invite or give opportunity for any submissions, or indeed any discussion between the applicant and his representative, about the proposed terms of the binding over order before he imposed it. While the magistrate stated during the course of the judicial review proceedings that he would have been prepared to listen to anything that the applicant's representative would have wished to say, the High Court accepted that the applicant's representative was effectively presented with a “fait accompli” of a nature which she had not come across before. In responding to an argument put forward on behalf of the magistrate that an advocate was under a duty to bring any procedural irregularity to the attention of the court during the hearing and not reserve such matter to be raised on appeal, Mr Justice Mance said: “That is of course right, but it assumes that the advocate appreciates that what happens does amount to a procedural irregularity and understands at the time the nature of the point. Here [the applicant's representative] does not appear to have had the confidence of whatever belief she had that something was not quite right, she did not raise the matter, and I do not think that the applicant should suffer from any failure, if there was any on her part, to react as another advocate, perhaps more familiar with this area of the law and practice, might have done.” (f) had the applicant or his representative been able to make submissions about the proposed order the magistrate might have been persuaded to impose different terms. Mr Justice Mance stated: “What Mr Burnett [counsel for the respondent] has submitted is that it cannot be shown that it would have made any difference if the magistrate had given to the applicant [and his counsel] an opportunity to make representations. However, it seems to me certainly not beyond the bounds of possibility, that if a proper opportunity had been given to [the applicant's counsel] to consider and address the matter after brief discussion between herself, the applicant and the friend [the proposed surety] the stringency of the proposed order - particularly in the alternative ... it had of 28 days' imprisonment - would have been one of the points on which she would have focused; the risk and consequences of a suitable surety being found, and in particular, of the friend at court ... not being regarded as suitable might well also have been highlighted. Mr Burnett did not seek to controvert that. The magistrate might, in such circumstances, have been persuaded to a different result. This is all, of course, speculative, but speculation though it may be, the reason why it is speculation is that the magistrate failed, in my judgment, to give the applicant or, on his behalf, [the applicant's representative] proper time or a proper opportunity to address the terms of the proposed bind over order, particularly so far as they involved a requirement that the applicant produce a surety in the sum of £250.”","{'applicant': 'Ivan Hooper', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 51, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2004}",001-67466

The case originated in an application (no. 42317/98) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Ivan Hooper (“the applicant”), on 16 July 1998.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr Burgess, a solicitor practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Emily Wilmott of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant alleged that neither he nor his legal representative were given the opportunity to address the magistrates' court prior to the imposition of a binding over order in respect of which he was later committed to prison for failure to comply with its terms.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

By a decision of 21 October 2003, the Court declared the application partly admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

On 3 January 1997 the applicant appeared before the magistrates' court, charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and failing to answer bail. He was legally represented. The applicant elected to be tried in the Crown Court. The stipendiary magistrate therefore adjourned the proceedings to enable a committal hearing to take place at a later date and proceeded to consider whether the applicant should be granted bail. During the course of that consideration, the applicant “reacted adversely” in court, causing a disturbance which led the magistrate to conclude that there existed a future risk of a breach of the peace by him. The magistrate therefore made an order binding the applicant over to keep the peace and to be of good behaviour under the Justices of the Peace Act 1361.

The applicant was “bound over” in his own recognisance of 50 pounds sterling (GBP) together with a surety of GBP 250. The precise terms of the order were found by the Divisional Court (in the later judicial review proceedings) to be unclear. However, the Divisional Court proceeded on the assumption that the order of the magistrates' court had fixed a period of 28 days' imprisonment in default of the applicant's own recognisance and/or a suitable surety. The magistrate did not give any opportunity for the applicant or his representative to make submissions about the terms of the order before it was imposed.

It appears that later on the day on which the binding over order was imposed, in the absence of both the applicant and his representative, the surety presented himself to the magistrate, who himself took the recognisance. The magistrate appears to have deemed the proposed surety unsuitable and to have done so on the ground that he did not have any readily available money. The applicant was committed to custody on the same day for 28 days. The Divisional Court later noted that he had remained in custody until 16 January 1997 or a little later.

On 2 June 1997 the applicant was granted leave to apply for judicial review of the decision to impose the binding over order.

On 20 January 1998 the Divisional Court granted the application for judicial review. The nature of the applicant's case was stated by the Divisional Court to be as follows: “It is not suggested by Mr. Daniel, for the applicant, that the magistrate had no power under [the Justices of the Peace Act 1361] or common law to impose a binding over order without consent, to require a surety or to impose a sentence of imprisonment in lieu. What is suggested is that there was a breach of natural justice or procedural irregularity in the way in which the magistrate dealt with the matter, without investigating further, or giving specific opportunity to the applicant or his legal representative to make representations about the terms of any binding over order.”

The Divisional Court (Lord Justice Simon Brown and Mr Justice Mance) agreed that the binding over order had been procedurally irregular and granted a declaration to that effect. During the course of their judgments, the judges of the Divisional Court held that: (a) previous domestic case-law had established that there were circumstances where failing to hear a defendant or his representative prior to imposing a binding over order containing a requirement of a recognisance could amount to a breach of the rules of natural justice. Mr Justice Mance quoted, inter alia, the headnote of the case of R. v. Central Criminal Court ex parte Boulding [1984] 1 QB 813 that: “... although there was no general obligation upon a court to afford a defendant an opportunity to be heard prior to binding him over, it was a breach of the rules of natural justice, unless the recognisance was of a trivial sum, for a court to bind a person over without inquiring into his means and giving him an opportunity to make representations as to the size of the recognisance.” (b) the position where there was a requirement for a surety was even clearer. A surety required the separate approval of the court as to his suitability. This was outside the control of the person to be bound over and yet could have drastic consequences for him where, as in the present case, it resulted in his serving a period of imprisonment imposed as an alternative; (c) in such circumstances, magistrates needed to take particular care lest, in effect, they imposed a binding order which amounted to an automatic sentence of imprisonment without appreciating what they were doing; (d) a defendant ought not to be put at peril of a prison sentence in default of finding a surety unless he had first been specifically invited to address the magistrates' court upon that point; (e) the magistrate did not expressly invite or give opportunity for any submissions, or indeed any discussion between the applicant and his representative, about the proposed terms of the binding over order before he imposed it. While the magistrate stated during the course of the judicial review proceedings that he would have been prepared to listen to anything that the applicant's representative would have wished to say, the High Court accepted that the applicant's representative was effectively presented with a “fait accompli” of a nature which she had not come across before. In responding to an argument put forward on behalf of the magistrate that an advocate was under a duty to bring any procedural irregularity to the attention of the court during the hearing and not reserve such matter to be raised on appeal, Mr Justice Mance said: “That is of course right, but it assumes that the advocate appreciates that what happens does amount to a procedural irregularity and understands at the time the nature of the point. Here [the applicant's representative] does not appear to have had the confidence of whatever belief she had that something was not quite right, she did not raise the matter, and I do not think that the applicant should suffer from any failure, if there was any on her part, to react as another advocate, perhaps more familiar with this area of the law and practice, might have done.” (f) had the applicant or his representative been able to make submissions about the proposed order the magistrate might have been persuaded to impose different terms. Mr Justice Mance stated: “What Mr Burnett [counsel for the respondent] has submitted is that it cannot be shown that it would have made any difference if the magistrate had given to the applicant [and his counsel] an opportunity to make representations. However, it seems to me certainly not beyond the bounds of possibility, that if a proper opportunity had been given to [the applicant's counsel] to consider and address the matter after brief discussion between herself, the applicant and the friend [the proposed surety] the stringency of the proposed order - particularly in the alternative ... it had of 28 days' imprisonment - would have been one of the points on which she would have focused; the risk and consequences of a suitable surety being found, and in particular, of the friend at court ... not being regarded as suitable might well also have been highlighted.

The case originated in an application (no. 63737/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Stephen Arthur Perry (“the applicant”), on 6 October 2000.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr P. Cameron, a solicitor practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant complained, under Article 8 of the Convention, that the police covertly videotaped him for identification purposes and used the material in the prosecution against him.

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

By a decision of 26 September 2002, the Court declared the application partly admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine), the parties replied in writing to each other's observations.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1964 and is currently detained in HM Prison Brixton.

In 1997, there were a series of armed robberies of mini-cab drivers in and around Wolverhampton. Each robbery was carried out in the same way by a person posing as a passenger at night. Each involved violence. The first robbery was committed on 15 April 1997 (for which the applicant was later acquitted). On 17 April 1997, the applicant was arrested and agreed to an identification parade on 15 May 1997. He was released pending the parade.

On 30 April 1997, a second robbery, later alleged in count 2 of the indictment against the applicant, was committed. On 1 May 1997, the applicant was arrested in relation to that offence. The applicant again agreed to participate in an identification parade to be held on 15 May and was then released. However, on that date, the applicant did not appear for the identification parade but instead sent a doctor's note stating that he was too ill to go to work. A subsequent identification parade was set for 5 June 1997. Notice to that effect was sent to the applicant's residence. He did not appear for identification on the specified date, stating later that he did not receive such notification as he had changed address.

On 27 June 1997, the applicant was arrested on an unrelated matter at which time he gave the address to which the previous notification was sent.

On 21 July 1997, a robbery, for which the applicant was charged in count 3 of his indictment, occurred. The applicant was arrested on 1 August 1997 and later acquitted on this count. The applicant agreed to stand on an identification parade scheduled to take place on 11 September. On 3 September, the applicant was interviewed with respect to another unconnected matter and said that he would attend the parade on 11 September. On that date, he did not in fact attend.

On the 17 September 1997, the robbery alleged in count 4 occurred, while a further robbery alleged in count 5 took place on 24 October 1997.

An important part of the prosecution's case rested almost entirely on the ability of the witnesses to visually identify the perpetrator. For this reason, submitting the applicant to an identification parade was of great importance for the prosecution. Given the failure of the applicant to attend the arranged identification parades, the police decided to arrange a video identification parade. Permission to covertly video the applicant for identification purposes was sought from the Deputy Chief Constable for the West Midlands Police Force under the Home Office Guidelines on the Use of Equipment in Police Surveillance Operations 1984.

On 19 November 1997, the applicant was taken from Strangeways Prison (where he was being detained on another matter) to the Bilston Street police station. The prison, and the applicant, had been informed that this was for identification purposes and further interviews concerning the armed robberies. On arrival at the police station, he was asked to participate in an identification parade. He refused.

Meanwhile, on his arrival at the police station, he was filmed by the custody suite camera which was kept running at all times and was in an area through which police personnel and other suspects came and went. An engineer had adjusted the camera to ensure that it took clear pictures during his visit. A compilation tape was prepared in which eleven volunteers imitated the actions of the applicant as captured on the covert video. This video was shown to various witnesses of the armed robberies, of whom two positively identified the applicant as involved in the second and fourth robberies. Neither the applicant nor his solicitor were informed that a tape had been made or used for identification parade purposes or given an opportunity to view it prior to its use.

The applicant's trial commenced in January 1999.

At the outset, the applicant's counsel made an application pursuant to section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 that evidence of the video identification should not be admitted. The judge heard submissions from the prosecution and defence during a preliminary hearing (“voir dire”) on 11 and 12 January 1999. On 14 January 1999, the trial judge ruled that the evidence should be admitted. When shortly afterwards this judge became unable to sit, the new trial judge heard the matter afresh. In his ruling of 26 February 1999, he found that the police had failed to comply with paragraphs D.2.11, D.2.15 and D.2.16 of the Code of Practice, inter alia with regard to their failure to ask the applicant for his consent to the video, to inform him of its creation, to inform him of its use in an identification parade, and of his own rights in that respect (namely, to give him an opportunity to view the video, object to its contents and to inform him of the right for his solicitor to be present when witnesses saw the videotape). However, the judge concluded that there had been no unfairness arising from the use of the video. Eleven persons had been filmed for comparison purposes rather than the required eight and were all within comparative height, age and appearance. Even though the applicant's solicitor was not present to verify the procedures adopted when the witnesses were shown the videos, the entire process had been recorded on video and this had been shown to the court which had the opportunity of seeing exactly how the entire video identification process had been operated. The judge ruled that the evidence was therefore admissible.

The trial lasted 17 days, the applicant and 31 witnesses giving live evidence. During the course of it, the applicant discharged all his legal representatives (leading and junior counsel and solicitors) and conducted his own defence as he was dissatisfied with the way his defence was being conducted. In his summing-up to the jury, the trial judge warned the jury at considerable length about the “special need for caution” before convicting any defendant in a case turning partly on identification evidence and told the jury to ask themselves whether the video was a fair test of the ability of the witnesses to pick out their attacker, telling them that if it was not a fair test they should not give much, if any weight, to the identifications and also that if there was any possibility that the police planned a video identification rather than a live identification to put the applicant at a disadvantage, they could not rely safely on the video identification evidence. The jury were also made aware of the applicant's complaints about the honesty and fairness of his treatment by the police and the alleged breaches of the code.

On 17 March 1999, the jury convicted the applicant of three counts of robbery and acquitted him of two others. The judge sentenced him to five years' imprisonment.

The applicant applied for leave to appeal against conviction, inter alia, alleging that the trial judge had erred in not excluding the evidence obtained as a result of the covert identification video and that the conviction was unsafe due to significant and substantial breaches of the code of practice relating to identification parades. Leave was granted by a single judge of the Court of Appeal.

On 3 April 2000, after a hearing at which the applicant was represented by counsel, the Court of Appeal rejected his appeal, finding that the trial judge had dealt with the matter in a full and careful ruling, that he had been entitled to reach the conclusion that the evidence was admissible and that he had directed the jury to give the evidence little or no weight if it was in any way unfair. It refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords.

The case originated in an application (no. 63737/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Stephen Arthur Perry (“the applicant”), on 6 October 2000.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr P. Cameron, a solicitor practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant complained, under Article 8 of the Convention, that the police covertly videotaped him for identification purposes and used the material in the prosecution against him.

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

By a decision of 26 September 2002, the Court declared the application partly admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine), the parties replied in writing to each other's observations.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1964 and is currently detained in HM Prison Brixton.

In 1997, there were a series of armed robberies of mini-cab drivers in and around Wolverhampton. Each robbery was carried out in the same way by a person posing as a passenger at night. Each involved violence. The first robbery was committed on 15 April 1997 (for which the applicant was later acquitted). On 17 April 1997, the applicant was arrested and agreed to an identification parade on 15 May 1997. He was released pending the parade.

On 30 April 1997, a second robbery, later alleged in count 2 of the indictment against the applicant, was committed. On 1 May 1997, the applicant was arrested in relation to that offence. The applicant again agreed to participate in an identification parade to be held on 15 May and was then released. However, on that date, the applicant did not appear for the identification parade but instead sent a doctor's note stating that he was too ill to go to work. A subsequent identification parade was set for 5 June 1997. Notice to that effect was sent to the applicant's residence. He did not appear for identification on the specified date, stating later that he did not receive such notification as he had changed address.

On 27 June 1997, the applicant was arrested on an unrelated matter at which time he gave the address to which the previous notification was sent.

On 21 July 1997, a robbery, for which the applicant was charged in count 3 of his indictment, occurred. The applicant was arrested on 1 August 1997 and later acquitted on this count. The applicant agreed to stand on an identification parade scheduled to take place on 11 September. On 3 September, the applicant was interviewed with respect to another unconnected matter and said that he would attend the parade on 11 September. On that date, he did not in fact attend.

On the 17 September 1997, the robbery alleged in count 4 occurred, while a further robbery alleged in count 5 took place on 24 October 1997.

An important part of the prosecution's case rested almost entirely on the ability of the witnesses to visually identify the perpetrator. For this reason, submitting the applicant to an identification parade was of great importance for the prosecution. Given the failure of the applicant to attend the arranged identification parades, the police decided to arrange a video identification parade. Permission to covertly video the applicant for identification purposes was sought from the Deputy Chief Constable for the West Midlands Police Force under the Home Office Guidelines on the Use of Equipment in Police Surveillance Operations 1984.

On 19 November 1997, the applicant was taken from Strangeways Prison (where he was being detained on another matter) to the Bilston Street police station. The prison, and the applicant, had been informed that this was for identification purposes and further interviews concerning the armed robberies. On arrival at the police station, he was asked to participate in an identification parade. He refused.

Meanwhile, on his arrival at the police station, he was filmed by the custody suite camera which was kept running at all times and was in an area through which police personnel and other suspects came and went. An engineer had adjusted the camera to ensure that it took clear pictures during his visit. A compilation tape was prepared in which eleven volunteers imitated the actions of the applicant as captured on the covert video. This video was shown to various witnesses of the armed robberies, of whom two positively identified the applicant as involved in the second and fourth robberies. Neither the applicant nor his solicitor were informed that a tape had been made or used for identification parade purposes or given an opportunity to view it prior to its use.

The applicant's trial commenced in January 1999.

At the outset, the applicant's counsel made an application pursuant to section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 that evidence of the video identification should not be admitted. The judge heard submissions from the prosecution and defence during a preliminary hearing (“voir dire”) on 11 and 12 January 1999. On 14 January 1999, the trial judge ruled that the evidence should be admitted. When shortly afterwards this judge became unable to sit, the new trial judge heard the matter afresh. In his ruling of 26 February 1999, he found that the police had failed to comply with paragraphs D.2.11, D.2.15 and D.2.16 of the Code of Practice, inter alia with regard to their failure to ask the applicant for his consent to the video, to inform him of its creation, to inform him of its use in an identification parade, and of his own rights in that respect (namely, to give him an opportunity to view the video, object to its contents and to inform him of the right for his solicitor to be present when witnesses saw the videotape). However, the judge concluded that there had been no unfairness arising from the use of the video. Eleven persons had been filmed for comparison purposes rather than the required eight and were all within comparative height, age and appearance. Even though the applicant's solicitor was not present to verify the procedures adopted when the witnesses were shown the videos, the entire process had been recorded on video and this had been shown to the court which had the opportunity of seeing exactly how the entire video identification process had been operated. The judge ruled that the evidence was therefore admissible.

The trial lasted 17 days, the applicant and 31 witnesses giving live evidence. During the course of it, the applicant discharged all his legal representatives (leading and junior counsel and solicitors) and conducted his own defence as he was dissatisfied with the way his defence was being conducted. In his summing-up to the jury, the trial judge warned the jury at considerable length about the “special need for caution” before convicting any defendant in a case turning partly on identification evidence and told the jury to ask themselves whether the video was a fair test of the ability of the witnesses to pick out their attacker, telling them that if it was not a fair test they should not give much, if any weight, to the identifications and also that if there was any possibility that the police planned a video identification rather than a live identification to put the applicant at a disadvantage, they could not rely safely on the video identification evidence. The jury were also made aware of the applicant's complaints about the honesty and fairness of his treatment by the police and the alleged breaches of the code.

On 17 March 1999, the jury convicted the applicant of three counts of robbery and acquitted him of two others. The judge sentenced him to five years' imprisonment.

On 19 November 1997, the applicant was taken from Strangeways Prison (where he was being detained on another matter) to the Bilston Street police station. The prison, and the applicant, had been informed that this was for identification purposes and further interviews concerning the armed robberies. On arrival at the police station, he was asked to participate in an identification parade. He refused.

Meanwhile, on his arrival at the police station, he was filmed by the custody suite camera which was kept running at all times and was in an area through which police personnel and other suspects came and went. An engineer had adjusted the camera to ensure that it took clear pictures during his visit. A compilation tape was prepared in which eleven volunteers imitated the actions of the applicant as captured on the covert video. This video was shown to various witnesses of the armed robberies, of whom two positively identified the applicant as involved in the second and fourth robberies. Neither the applicant nor his solicitor were informed that a tape had been made or used for identification parade purposes or given an opportunity to view it prior to its use.

The applicant's trial commenced in January 1999.

At the outset, the applicant's counsel made an application pursuant to section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 that evidence of the video identification should not be admitted. The judge heard submissions from the prosecution and defence during a preliminary hearing (“voir dire”) on 11 and 12 January 1999. On 14 January 1999, the trial judge ruled that the evidence should be admitted. When shortly afterwards this judge became unable to sit, the new trial judge heard the matter afresh. In his ruling of 26 February 1999, he found that the police had failed to comply with paragraphs D.2.11, D.2.15 and D.2.16 of the Code of Practice, inter alia with regard to their failure to ask the applicant for his consent to the video, to inform him of its creation, to inform him of its use in an identification parade, and of his own rights in that respect (namely, to give him an opportunity to view the video, object to its contents and to inform him of the right for his solicitor to be present when witnesses saw the videotape). However, the judge concluded that there had been no unfairness arising from the use of the video. Eleven persons had been filmed for comparison purposes rather than the required eight and were all within comparative height, age and appearance. Even though the applicant's solicitor was not present to verify the procedures adopted when the witnesses were shown the videos, the entire process had been recorded on video and this had been shown to the court which had the opportunity of seeing exactly how the entire video identification process had been operated. The judge ruled that the evidence was therefore admissible.

The trial lasted 17 days, the applicant and 31 witnesses giving live evidence. During the course of it, the applicant discharged all his legal representatives (leading and junior counsel and solicitors) and conducted his own defence as he was dissatisfied with the way his defence was being conducted. In his summing-up to the jury, the trial judge warned the jury at considerable length about the “special need for caution” before convicting any defendant in a case turning partly on identification evidence and told the jury to ask themselves whether the video was a fair test of the ability of the witnesses to pick out their attacker, telling them that if it was not a fair test they should not give much, if any weight, to the identifications and also that if there was any possibility that the police planned a video identification rather than a live identification to put the applicant at a disadvantage, they could not rely safely on the video identification evidence. The jury were also made aware of the applicant's complaints about the honesty and fairness of his treatment by the police and the alleged breaches of the code.

On 17 March 1999, the jury convicted the applicant of three counts of robbery and acquitted him of two others. The judge sentenced him to five years' imprisonment.

The applicant applied for leave to appeal against conviction, inter alia, alleging that the trial judge had erred in not excluding the evidence obtained as a result of the covert identification video and that the conviction was unsafe due to significant and substantial breaches of the code of practice relating to identification parades. Leave was granted by a single judge of the Court of Appeal.

On 3 April 2000, after a hearing at which the applicant was represented by counsel, the Court of Appeal rejected his appeal, finding that the trial judge had dealt with the matter in a full and careful ruling, that he had been entitled to reach the conclusion that the evidence was admissible and that he had directed the jury to give the evidence little or no weight if it was in any way unfair. It refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords.

On 14 April 2000, the applicant applied to the House of Lords. It rejected the application. The solicitors claimed that they were informed on 7 July 2000.","{'applicant': 'Stephen Arthur Perry', 'articles': [91, 34, 56, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2003}",001-61228

The case originated in an application (no. 63737/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Stephen Arthur Perry (“the applicant”), on 6 October 2000.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr P. Cameron, a solicitor practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant complained, under Article 8 of the Convention, that the police covertly videotaped him for identification purposes and used the material in the prosecution against him.

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

By a decision of 26 September 2002, the Court declared the application partly admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine), the parties replied in writing to each other's observations.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1964 and is currently detained in HM Prison Brixton.

In 1997, there were a series of armed robberies of mini-cab drivers in and around Wolverhampton. Each robbery was carried out in the same way by a person posing as a passenger at night. Each involved violence. The first robbery was committed on 15 April 1997 (for which the applicant was later acquitted). On 17 April 1997, the applicant was arrested and agreed to an identification parade on 15 May 1997. He was released pending the parade.

On 30 April 1997, a second robbery, later alleged in count 2 of the indictment against the applicant, was committed. On 1 May 1997, the applicant was arrested in relation to that offence. The applicant again agreed to participate in an identification parade to be held on 15 May and was then released. However, on that date, the applicant did not appear for the identification parade but instead sent a doctor's note stating that he was too ill to go to work. A subsequent identification parade was set for 5 June 1997. Notice to that effect was sent to the applicant's residence. He did not appear for identification on the specified date, stating later that he did not receive such notification as he had changed address.

On 27 June 1997, the applicant was arrested on an unrelated matter at which time he gave the address to which the previous notification was sent.

On 21 July 1997, a robbery, for which the applicant was charged in count 3 of his indictment, occurred. The applicant was arrested on 1 August 1997 and later acquitted on this count. The applicant agreed to stand on an identification parade scheduled to take place on 11 September. On 3 September, the applicant was interviewed with respect to another unconnected matter and said that he would attend the parade on 11 September. On that date, he did not in fact attend.

On the 17 September 1997, the robbery alleged in count 4 occurred, while a further robbery alleged in count 5 took place on 24 October 1997.

An important part of the prosecution's case rested almost entirely on the ability of the witnesses to visually identify the perpetrator. For this reason, submitting the applicant to an identification parade was of great importance for the prosecution. Given the failure of the applicant to attend the arranged identification parades, the police decided to arrange a video identification parade. Permission to covertly video the applicant for identification purposes was sought from the Deputy Chief Constable for the West Midlands Police Force under the Home Office Guidelines on the Use of Equipment in Police Surveillance Operations 1984.

On 19 November 1997, the applicant was taken from Strangeways Prison (where he was being detained on another matter) to the Bilston Street police station. The prison, and the applicant, had been informed that this was for identification purposes and further interviews concerning the armed robberies. On arrival at the police station, he was asked to participate in an identification parade. He refused.

Meanwhile, on his arrival at the police station, he was filmed by the custody suite camera which was kept running at all times and was in an area through which police personnel and other suspects came and went. An engineer had adjusted the camera to ensure that it took clear pictures during his visit. A compilation tape was prepared in which eleven volunteers imitated the actions of the applicant as captured on the covert video. This video was shown to various witnesses of the armed robberies, of whom two positively identified the applicant as involved in the second and fourth robberies. Neither the applicant nor his solicitor were informed that a tape had been made or used for identification parade purposes or given an opportunity to view it prior to its use.

The applicant's trial commenced in January 1999.

At the outset, the applicant's counsel made an application pursuant to section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 that evidence of the video identification should not be admitted. The judge heard submissions from the prosecution and defence during a preliminary hearing (“voir dire”) on 11 and 12 January 1999. On 14 January 1999, the trial judge ruled that the evidence should be admitted. When shortly afterwards this judge became unable to sit, the new trial judge heard the matter afresh. In his ruling of 26 February 1999, he found that the police had failed to comply with paragraphs D.2.11, D.2.15 and D.2.16 of the Code of Practice, inter alia with regard to their failure to ask the applicant for his consent to the video, to inform him of its creation, to inform him of its use in an identification parade, and of his own rights in that respect (namely, to give him an opportunity to view the video, object to its contents and to inform him of the right for his solicitor to be present when witnesses saw the videotape).

The jury were also made aware of the applicant's complaints about the honesty and fairness of his treatment by the police and the alleged breaches of the code.

On 17 March 1999, the jury convicted the applicant of three counts of robbery and acquitted him of two others. The judge sentenced him to five years' imprisonment.

The case originated in an application (no. 14399/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Rupert John Massey (“the applicant”), on 25 March 2002.

The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Derek Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant alleges that the criminal proceedings brought against him exceeded a reasonable time, invoking Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

On 8 April 2003, the Chamber invited the respondent Government to make observations on the applicant's complaints about the length of proceedings and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.

By a decision of 6 January 2004, the Court declared the remainder of the application admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

THE FACTS

The applicant was born in November 1945 and is resident in Richmond-upon-Thames, Surrey.

In August 1995, the police received a telephone call from GL alleging that the applicant had sexually abused him from December 1981 until December 1983. On 18 September 1995, GL informed the police that he had decided not to make a statement of complaint but on 29 January 1996 stated that he now wished to pursue the matter. On 2 February 1996, the police told GL that there would be a long delay in taking his statement due to other more pressing commitments. On 26 September 1996, the police started to take GL's statement, a process which continued on 18 and 19 December 1996 and several dates at the beginning of January 1997.

On 22 April 1996, DM telephoned the police and stated that he too had been sexually abused by the applicant from April 1973 until April 1978. DM informed the police that GL had contacted him and asked if he knew anyone else who had been sexually abused by the applicant and DM had answered that he had been. The police told DM that there would be a long delay before his statement could be taken. The police contacted DM again on 25 January 1997. His statement was taken over several days and completed on 4 February 1997. At a police interview on 25 January 1997, DM stated that he believed that the applicant had abused four other people including his brother, AM.

On 20 March 1997, the applicant was arrested on suspicion of indecent assaults on GL and DM. He was interviewed by the police on 21 March 1997 and was subsequently released on police bail.

On 4 June 1997, AM made a statement asserting that he had been abused by the applicant from November 1971 until November 1972.

On 2 July 1997, the police interviewed the applicant regarding the allegations made by AM. In October 1997, the police fingerprinted and took DNA swabs from the applicant. On 5 December 1997, the applicant was interviewed with respect to allegations of indecent assault made by a fourth person, MC, and was then charged with a number of counts of indecent assault. On 7 January 1998, MC withdrew his complaint.

From January to March 1998, the applicant made three remand appearances at the Magistrates' court. He requested a full committal hearing with consideration of the evidence. Shortly before the date set for the committal, it appeared that AM had left to work abroad. On 18 and 19 May 1998, the Magistrates' court refused the applicant's applications to discontinue the proceedings on the grounds of delay and adjourned the committal to allow AM, who was working abroad, to return and give evidence.

On 4 September 1998, the applicant was committed for trial on 20 counts relating to three different victims. On 18 December 1998, the trial was fixed for 14 April 1999. However, on 30 March 1999, the trial was delayed because the applicant was suffering from depression and memory loss. The applicant stated that the judge ordered a date to be fixed for trial from 1 June 1999 as he was responding well to medication and was fit to continue. In June 1999, the Crown Court refused the applicant's applications to stay the proceedings as an abuse of process or to sever the proceedings so that the applicant would be tried separately in respect of each complainant.

At the beginning of the trial, on 22 November 1999, the trial judge refused another application by the applicant for the proceedings to be stayed as an abuse of process. The applicant had argued that the trial judge should grant a stay on the grounds that the delay in the complainants coming forward prejudiced his defence since it was not possible to investigate the allegations or approach now deceased witnesses, and that the delay in the conduct of the police investigation allowed the contamination of evidence by contact between GL and DM. The judge considered that the delay in the complainants coming forward did not justify a stay of proceedings. He further deemed that, although the police delay in taking statements was “quite inadequate”, the applicant had not shown that any improper or negligent act or omission of the police had permitted contact between GL and DM or that anything had occurred which contaminated their evidence. The judge considered that the prosecution had discharged any onus upon them to establish that a fair trial was possible.

On 7 December 1999, the applicant was convicted of 16 counts of indecent assault and acquitted of four counts of buggery. He was sentenced to a total of six years' imprisonment and was made subject to the registration requirements of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 for an indefinite period.

On 29 December 1999, the applicant sought leave to appeal against conviction and sentence on various grounds including that the trial judge should have stayed the proceedings as an abuse of process. On 5 February 2000, the applicant's counsel requested an extension of time to perfect the grounds of appeal. This was granted. On 3 April 2000, a single judge of the Court of Appeal refused to grant leave to appeal against conviction, finding inter alia that the trial judge was entitled to conclude that the proceedings did not constitute an abuse of process. The single judge also refused leave to appeal against sentence.

On 19 April 2000, the applicant renewed his application. On 12 December 2000, the full Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal against conviction, inter alia, on the ground that the trial judge should have granted the applications to stay the proceedings as an abuse of process.

In February 2001, the applicant's leading counsel advised that the case involved “complicated and novel arguments” and applied for an extension of legal aid to junior counsel. This was granted. In March 2001, counsel lodged the applicant's skeleton argument and at the end of the month the case was ready for listing. In May 2001, the case was stayed pending the judgment of the Court of Appeal in an Attorney-General reference case which also concerned issues of delay and abuse.

On 20 December 2001, the Court of Appeal refused a renewed application for leave to appeal against sentence and dismissed the appeal against conviction. As regarded the applicant's complaints of delay in the police investigation, which was alleged to have allowed the contamination of the evidence of GL and DM and created the risk of collusion between all three complainants, the Court of Appeal concluded that a stay of proceedings on the grounds of delay could only be granted in exceptional circumstances and only if the defendant showed that a fair trial was impossible. The court considered that Article 6 of the Convention was inapplicable because the applicant had been convicted before the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force but added that, even if Article 6 applied, it would not affect their assessment on the facts. It considered that, on the limited documentary material before him, the judge could not have come to any other conclusion than that a fair trial was possible. The court further deemed that there was no basis to conclude that the judge was wrong to refuse the application for a stay made at the end of the prosecution case: “Unsatisfactory though the police delay was, the police had, on GL's own evidence, advised him not to talk to others involved. He deliberately ignored this warning, including during the period when he was preparing his statement. It was not the police delay, but GL's ignoring of the police warning that led to discussion between potential witnesses. Even if the two witnesses' statements had been taken over the same period, such ignoring of police advice could not be prevented. DM was also advised not to talk to others. Even assuming that the police failed to give appropriate or sufficient warnings, it was not shown that the evidence given by Crown witnesses was thereby contaminated, in the sense of being affected or changed, whether deliberately or inadvertently, by the contacts which took place between GL and DM.”","{'applicant': 'Rupert John Massey', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2004}",001-67470

On 8 April 2003, the Chamber invited the respondent Government to make observations on the applicant's complaints about the length of proceedings and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.

By a decision of 6 January 2004, the Court declared the remainder of the application admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

THE FACTS

The applicant was born in November 1945 and is resident in Richmond-upon-Thames, Surrey.

In August 1995, the police received a telephone call from GL alleging that the applicant had sexually abused him from December 1981 until December 1983. On 18 September 1995, GL informed the police that he had decided not to make a statement of complaint but on 29 January 1996 stated that he now wished to pursue the matter. On 2 February 1996, the police told GL that there would be a long delay in taking his statement due to other more pressing commitments. On 26 September 1996, the police started to take GL's statement, a process which continued on 18 and 19 December 1996 and several dates at the beginning of January 1997.

On 22 April 1996, DM telephoned the police and stated that he too had been sexually abused by the applicant from April 1973 until April 1978. DM informed the police that GL had contacted him and asked if he knew anyone else who had been sexually abused by the applicant and DM had answered that he had been. The police told DM that there would be a long delay before his statement could be taken. The police contacted DM again on 25 January 1997. His statement was taken over several days and completed on 4 February 1997. At a police interview on 25 January 1997, DM stated that he believed that the applicant had abused four other people including his brother, AM.

On 20 March 1997, the applicant was arrested on suspicion of indecent assaults on GL and DM. He was interviewed by the police on 21 March 1997 and was subsequently released on police bail.

On 4 June 1997, AM made a statement asserting that he had been abused by the applicant from November 1971 until November 1972.

On 2 July 1997, the police interviewed the applicant regarding the allegations made by AM. In October 1997, the police fingerprinted and took DNA swabs from the applicant. On 5 December 1997, the applicant was interviewed with respect to allegations of indecent assault made by a fourth person, MC, and was then charged with a number of counts of indecent assault. On 7 January 1998, MC withdrew his complaint.

From January to March 1998, the applicant made three remand appearances at the Magistrates' court. He requested a full committal hearing with consideration of the evidence. Shortly before the date set for the committal, it appeared that AM had left to work abroad. On 18 and 19 May 1998, the Magistrates' court refused the applicant's applications to discontinue the proceedings on the grounds of delay and adjourned the committal to allow AM, who was working abroad, to return and give evidence.

On 4 September 1998, the applicant was committed for trial on 20 counts relating to three different victims. On 18 December 1998, the trial was fixed for 14 April 1999. However, on 30 March 1999, the trial was delayed because the applicant was suffering from depression and memory loss. The applicant stated that the judge ordered a date to be fixed for trial from 1 June 1999 as he was responding well to medication and was fit to continue. In June 1999, the Crown Court refused the applicant's applications to stay the proceedings as an abuse of process or to sever the proceedings so that the applicant would be tried separately in respect of each complainant.

At the beginning of the trial, on 22 November 1999, the trial judge refused another application by the applicant for the proceedings to be stayed as an abuse of process. The applicant had argued that the trial judge should grant a stay on the grounds that the delay in the complainants coming forward prejudiced his defence since it was not possible to investigate the allegations or approach now deceased witnesses, and that the delay in the conduct of the police investigation allowed the contamination of evidence by contact between GL and DM. The judge considered that the delay in the complainants coming forward did not justify a stay of proceedings. He further deemed that, although the police delay in taking statements was “quite inadequate”, the applicant had not shown that any improper or negligent act or omission of the police had permitted contact between GL and DM or that anything had occurred which contaminated their evidence. The judge considered that the prosecution had discharged any onus upon them to establish that a fair trial was possible.

On 7 December 1999, the applicant was convicted of 16 counts of indecent assault and acquitted of four counts of buggery. He was sentenced to a total of six years' imprisonment and was made subject to the registration requirements of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 for an indefinite period.

On 29 December 1999, the applicant sought leave to appeal against conviction and sentence on various grounds including that the trial judge should have stayed the proceedings as an abuse of process. On 5 February 2000, the applicant's counsel requested an extension of time to perfect the grounds of appeal. This was granted. On 3 April 2000, a single judge of the Court of Appeal refused to grant leave to appeal against conviction, finding inter alia that the trial judge was entitled to conclude that the proceedings did not constitute an abuse of process. The single judge also refused leave to appeal against sentence.

On 19 April 2000, the applicant renewed his application. On 12 December 2000, the full Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal against conviction, inter alia, on the ground that the trial judge should have granted the applications to stay the proceedings as an abuse of process.

In February 2001, the applicant's leading counsel advised that the case involved “complicated and novel arguments” and applied for an extension of legal aid to junior counsel. This was granted. In March 2001, counsel lodged the applicant's skeleton argument and at the end of the month the case was ready for listing. In May 2001, the case was stayed pending the judgment of the Court of Appeal in an Attorney-General reference case which also concerned issues of delay and abuse.

On 20 December 2001, the Court of Appeal refused a renewed application for leave to appeal against sentence and dismissed the appeal against conviction. As regarded the applicant's complaints of delay in the police investigation, which was alleged to have allowed the contamination of the evidence of GL and DM and created the risk of collusion between all three complainants, the Court of Appeal concluded that a stay of proceedings on the grounds of delay could only be granted in exceptional circumstances and only if the defendant showed that a fair trial was impossible. The court considered that Article 6 of the Convention was inapplicable because the applicant had been convicted before the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force but added that, even if Article 6 applied, it would not affect their assessment on the facts. It considered that, on the limited documentary material before him, the judge could not have come to any other conclusion than that a fair trial was possible. The court further deemed that there was no basis to conclude that the judge was wrong to refuse the application for a stay made at the end of the prosecution case: “Unsatisfactory though the police delay was, the police had, on GL's own evidence, advised him not to talk to others involved. He deliberately ignored this warning, including during the period when he was preparing his statement. It was not the police delay, but GL's ignoring of the police warning that led to discussion between potential witnesses. Even if the two witnesses' statements had been taken over the same period, such ignoring of police advice could not be prevented. DM was also advised not to talk to others. Even assuming that the police failed to give appropriate or sufficient warnings, it was not shown that the evidence given by Crown witnesses was thereby contaminated, in the sense of being affected or changed, whether deliberately or inadvertently, by the contacts which took place between GL and DM.”","{'applicant': 'Rupert John Massey', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2004}",001-67470

THE FACTS

The applicant was born in November 1945 and is resident in Richmond-upon-Thames, Surrey.

In August 1995, the police received a telephone call from GL alleging that the applicant had sexually abused him from December 1981 until December 1983. On 18 September 1995, GL informed the police that he had decided not to make a statement of complaint but on 29 January 1996 stated that he now wished to pursue the matter. On 2 February 1996, the police told GL that there would be a long delay in taking his statement due to other more pressing commitments. On 26 September 1996, the police started to take GL's statement, a process which continued on 18 and 19 December 1996 and several dates at the beginning of January 1997.

On 22 April 1996, DM telephoned the police and stated that he too had been sexually abused by the applicant from April 1973 until April 1978. DM informed the police that GL had contacted him and asked if he knew anyone else who had been sexually abused by the applicant and DM had answered that he had been. The police told DM that there would be a long delay before his statement could be taken. The police contacted DM again on 25 January 1997. His statement was taken over several days and completed on 4 February 1997. At a police interview on 25 January 1997, DM stated that he believed that the applicant had abused four other people including his brother, AM.

On 20 March 1997, the applicant was arrested on suspicion of indecent assaults on GL and DM. He was interviewed by the police on 21 March 1997 and was subsequently released on police bail.

On 4 June 1997, AM made a statement asserting that he had been abused by the applicant from November 1971 until November 1972.

On 2 July 1997, the police interviewed the applicant regarding the allegations made by AM. In October 1997, the police fingerprinted and took DNA swabs from the applicant. On 5 December 1997, the applicant was interviewed with respect to allegations of indecent assault made by a fourth person, MC, and was then charged with a number of counts of indecent assault. On 7 January 1998, MC withdrew his complaint.

From January to March 1998, the applicant made three remand appearances at the Magistrates' court. He requested a full committal hearing with consideration of the evidence. Shortly before the date set for the committal, it appeared that AM had left to work abroad. On 18 and 19 May 1998, the Magistrates' court refused the applicant's applications to discontinue the proceedings on the grounds of delay and adjourned the committal to allow AM, who was working abroad, to return and give evidence.

On 4 September 1998, the applicant was committed for trial on 20 counts relating to three different victims. On 18 December 1998, the trial was fixed for 14 April 1999. However, on 30 March 1999, the trial was delayed because the applicant was suffering from depression and memory loss. The applicant stated that the judge ordered a date to be fixed for trial from 1 June 1999 as he was responding well to medication and was fit to continue. In June 1999, the Crown Court refused the applicant's applications to stay the proceedings as an abuse of process or to sever the proceedings so that the applicant would be tried separately in respect of each complainant.

At the beginning of the trial, on 22 November 1999, the trial judge refused another application by the applicant for the proceedings to be stayed as an abuse of process. The applicant had argued that the trial judge should grant a stay on the grounds that the delay in the complainants coming forward prejudiced his defence since it was not possible to investigate the allegations or approach now deceased witnesses, and that the delay in the conduct of the police investigation allowed the contamination of evidence by contact between GL and DM. The judge considered that the delay in the complainants coming forward did not justify a stay of proceedings. He further deemed that, although the police delay in taking statements was “quite inadequate”, the applicant had not shown that any improper or negligent act or omission of the police had permitted contact between GL and DM or that anything had occurred which contaminated their evidence. The judge considered that the prosecution had discharged any onus upon them to establish that a fair trial was possible.

On 7 December 1999, the applicant was convicted of 16 counts of indecent assault and acquitted of four counts of buggery. He was sentenced to a total of six years' imprisonment and was made subject to the registration requirements of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 for an indefinite period.

On 29 December 1999, the applicant sought leave to appeal against conviction and sentence on various grounds including that the trial judge should have stayed the proceedings as an abuse of process. On 5 February 2000, the applicant's counsel requested an extension of time to perfect the grounds of appeal. This was granted. On 3 April 2000, a single judge of the Court of Appeal refused to grant leave to appeal against conviction, finding inter alia that the trial judge was entitled to conclude that the proceedings did not constitute an abuse of process. The single judge also refused leave to appeal against sentence.

On 19 April 2000, the applicant renewed his application. On 12 December 2000, the full Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal against conviction, inter alia, on the ground that the trial judge should have granted the applications to stay the proceedings as an abuse of process.

In February 2001, the applicant's leading counsel advised that the case involved “complicated and novel arguments” and applied for an extension of legal aid to junior counsel. This was granted. In March 2001, counsel lodged the applicant's skeleton argument and at the end of the month the case was ready for listing. In May 2001, the case was stayed pending the judgment of the Court of Appeal in an Attorney-General reference case which also concerned issues of delay and abuse.

On 20 December 2001, the Court of Appeal refused a renewed application for leave to appeal against sentence and dismissed the appeal against conviction. As regarded the applicant's complaints of delay in the police investigation, which was alleged to have allowed the contamination of the evidence of GL and DM and created the risk of collusion between all three complainants, the Court of Appeal concluded that a stay of proceedings on the grounds of delay could only be granted in exceptional circumstances and only if the defendant showed that a fair trial was impossible. The court considered that Article 6 of the Convention was inapplicable because the applicant had been convicted before the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force but added that, even if Article 6 applied, it would not affect their assessment on the facts. It considered that, on the limited documentary material before him, the judge could not have come to any other conclusion than that a fair trial was possible. The court further deemed that there was no basis to conclude that the judge was wrong to refuse the application for a stay made at the end of the prosecution case: “Unsatisfactory though the police delay was, the police had, on GL's own evidence, advised him not to talk to others involved. He deliberately ignored this warning, including during the period when he was preparing his statement. It was not the police delay, but GL's ignoring of the police warning that led to discussion between potential witnesses. Even if the two witnesses' statements had been taken over the same period, such ignoring of police advice could not be prevented. DM was also advised not to talk to others. Even assuming that the police failed to give appropriate or sufficient warnings, it was not shown that the evidence given by Crown witnesses was thereby contaminated, in the sense of being affected or changed, whether deliberately or inadvertently, by the contacts which took place between GL and DM.”","{'applicant': 'Rupert John Massey', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2004}",001-67470

The case originated in an application (no. 56328/07) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Sierra Leonean national, Ms Husenatu Bah (“the applicant”), on 23 November 2007.

The applicant was represented by Pierce Glynn Solicitors, a firm of lawyers practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant alleged that she had been a victim of a violation of Article 14 of the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 8. On 1 December 2009 the Acting President of the Chamber decided to give notice of the application to the Government.

The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine of the Rules of Court), the parties replied in writing to each other’s observations. In addition, third-party comments were received from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which had been given leave by the Acting President of the Chamber to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 3). The respondent Government replied to those comments (Rule 44 § 6).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.

The applicant arrived in the United Kingdom in 2000 as an asylum seeker from Sierra Leone. Although her asylum claim was refused, she was granted exceptional leave to remain and then, in 2005, indefinite leave to remain. After she obtained indefinite leave to remain, she applied to have her son Mohamed Saliou Jalloh, a Sierra Leonean national born in 1994, join her in the United Kingdom. Her son arrived in January 2007, with conditional leave to remain in the United Kingdom, the condition being that he must not have recourse to public funds. He is considered as being “subject to immigration control” within the meaning of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, as is the applicant (see paragraph 12 below).

At the time of her son’s arrival in the United Kingdom, the applicant was renting a room in a private home. However, her landlord was unwilling to accommodate her son as well, and informed the applicant shortly after her son’s arrival that they would have to move out by 31 March 2007. The applicant applied to the London Borough of Southwark Council for assistance on 9 February 2007, on the basis that she had become unintentionally homeless. An unintentionally homeless person with a minor child would ordinarily qualify as being in priority need pursuant to section 189 of the Housing Act 1996 (see paragraph 13 below), and would thus be provided with suitable housing, usually within the locality. Those in priority need are considered to be a class of persons to whom reasonable preference must be given in the allocation of social housing. As there is a significant shortage of social housing in London, those in priority need would generally be placed in temporary accommodation until appropriate social housing became available. In the case of the applicant, however, as her son was subject to immigration control, he was disregarded by the Council in the determination of whether the applicant was in priority need, in accordance with section 185(4) of the Housing Act 1996. On 14 March 2007 the Council decided that the applicant was not therefore in priority need and not entitled to social housing.

The applicant requested a review of this decision, which was carried out by a senior officer, who reiterated that persons subject to immigration control are not eligible for housing assistance and that persons who are not eligible for housing assistance shall be disregarded when determining whether another person has a priority need for accommodation. As the applicant’s son was not eligible, the applicant did not have a priority need. Consideration was also given to the question of whether the applicant was vulnerable for any other reason; however, it was found that the applicant was not hindered in the performance of everyday tasks by any medical problems and that she was no less able to fend for herself than the average person. There was therefore no special reason to find that she was entitled to homelessness assistance due to vulnerability. On 24 May 2007 the original decision was upheld.

The Council assisted the applicant to find a private-sector tenancy in September 2007, which she accepted. The applicant and her son were not therefore at any point actually homeless. However, the private tenancy was more expensive than a social tenancy would have been, and was outside the Borough of Southwark and therefore far from the applicant’s previous employment and her son’s school. The applicant claimed that she had to give up her job after three months of commuting as she was unable to cope with the travel required, and that her son spent four hours per day travelling to and from school.

The applicant, who had remained on the waiting list for social housing in the Borough of Southwark, obtained an offer of a social tenancy of a one-bedroom flat in March 2009. She and her son therefore moved back to Southwark.","{'applicant': 'Husenatu Bah', 'articles': [91, 34, 56, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2011}",001-106448

As the applicant’s son was not eligible, the applicant did not have a priority need. Consideration was also given to the question of whether the applicant was vulnerable for any other reason; however, it was found that the applicant was not hindered in the performance of everyday tasks by any medical problems and that she was no less able to fend for herself than the average person. There was therefore no special reason to find that she was entitled to homelessness assistance due to vulnerability. On 24 May 2007 the original decision was upheld.

The Council assisted the applicant to find a private-sector tenancy in September 2007, which she accepted. The applicant and her son were not therefore at any point actually homeless. However, the private tenancy was more expensive than a social tenancy would have been, and was outside the Borough of Southwark and therefore far from the applicant’s previous employment and her son’s school. The applicant claimed that she had to give up her job after three months of commuting as she was unable to cope with the travel required, and that her son spent four hours per day travelling to and from school.

The applicant, who had remained on the waiting list for social housing in the Borough of Southwark, obtained an offer of a social tenancy of a one-bedroom flat in March 2009. She and her son therefore moved back to Southwark.","{'applicant': 'Husenatu Bah', 'articles': [91, 34, 56, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2011}",001-106448

The case originated in an application (no. 56328/07) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Sierra Leonean national, Ms Husenatu Bah (“the applicant”), on 23 November 2007.

The applicant was represented by Pierce Glynn Solicitors, a firm of lawyers practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant alleged that she had been a victim of a violation of Article 14 of the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 8. On 1 December 2009 the Acting President of the Chamber decided to give notice of the application to the Government.

The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine of the Rules of Court), the parties replied in writing to each other’s observations. In addition, third-party comments were received from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which had been given leave by the Acting President of the Chamber to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 3). The respondent Government replied to those comments (Rule 44 § 6).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.

The applicant arrived in the United Kingdom in 2000 as an asylum seeker from Sierra Leone. Although her asylum claim was refused, she was granted exceptional leave to remain and then, in 2005, indefinite leave to remain. After she obtained indefinite leave to remain, she applied to have her son Mohamed Saliou Jalloh, a Sierra Leonean national born in 1994, join her in the United Kingdom. Her son arrived in January 2007, with conditional leave to remain in the United Kingdom, the condition being that he must not have recourse to public funds. He is considered as being “subject to immigration control” within the meaning of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, as is the applicant (see paragraph 12 below).

At the time of her son’s arrival in the United Kingdom, the applicant was renting a room in a private home. However, her landlord was unwilling to accommodate her son as well, and informed the applicant shortly after her son’s arrival that they would have to move out by 31 March 2007. The applicant applied to the London Borough of Southwark Council for assistance on 9 February 2007, on the basis that she had become unintentionally homeless. An unintentionally homeless person with a minor child would ordinarily qualify as being in priority need pursuant to section 189 of the Housing Act 1996 (see paragraph 13 below), and would thus be provided with suitable housing, usually within the locality. Those in priority need are considered to be a class of persons to whom reasonable preference must be given in the allocation of social housing. As there is a significant shortage of social housing in London, those in priority need would generally be placed in temporary accommodation until appropriate social housing became available. In the case of the applicant, however, as her son was subject to immigration control, he was disregarded by the Council in the determination of whether the applicant was in priority need, in accordance with section 185(4) of the Housing Act 1996. On 14 March 2007 the Council decided that the applicant was not therefore in priority need and not entitled to social housing.

The applicant requested a review of this decision, which was carried out by a senior officer, who reiterated that persons subject to immigration control are not eligible for housing assistance and that persons who are not eligible for housing assistance shall be disregarded when determining whether another person has a priority need for accommodation. As the applicant’s son was not eligible, the applicant did not have a priority need. Consideration was also given to the question of whether the applicant was vulnerable for any other reason; however, it was found that the applicant was not hindered in the performance of everyday tasks by any medical problems and that she was no less able to fend for herself than the average person. There was therefore no special reason to find that she was entitled to homelessness assistance due to vulnerability. On 24 May 2007 the original decision was upheld.

The Council assisted the applicant to find a private-sector tenancy in September 2007, which she accepted. The applicant and her son were not therefore at any point actually homeless. However, the private tenancy was more expensive than a social tenancy would have been, and was outside the Borough of Southwark and therefore far from the applicant’s previous employment and her son’s school. The applicant claimed that she had to give up her job after three months of commuting as she was unable to cope with the travel required, and that her son spent four hours per day travelling to and from school.

The case originated in an application (no. 21773/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Fedai Şahin (“the applicant”), on 7 July 2000.

The applicant was represented by Mrs G. Altay, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

On 10 September 2007 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Turkey.

On 6 November 1992 the applicant was taken into custody within the context of a police operation carried out against an illegal organisation, namely the TKP/ML – TIKKO (the Turkish Communist Party-Marxist Leninist - Turkish Workers and Peasants’ Liberation Army). On 17 November 1992 the applicant was placed in detention on remand.

By an indictment dated 10 February 1993 the public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant before the Istanbul State Security Court, accusing him, inter alia, of membership of an illegal armed organisation and of involvement in activities which aimed at undermining the constitutional order of the State. The prosecution sought the death penalty under Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code.

On 18 June 1999 the Constitution was amended and the military judge sitting on the bench of the Istanbul State Security Court was replaced by a civilian judge.

On 12 June 2000 the applicant was convicted as charged by the Istanbul State Security Court and sentenced to death.

On 15 May 2001 the Court of Cassation quashed the applicant’s conviction for procedural reasons. The case was remitted to the Istanbul State Security Court for further examination.

On 18 July 2001 the Istanbul State Security Court ordered the applicant’s release pending trial.

On 7 May 2004 State Security Courts were abolished following a constitutional amendment and the applicant’s case was transmitted to the Istanbul Assize Court.

On 31 January 2005 the Istanbul Assize Court found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment, pursuant to Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code.

On 20 March 2006 the Court of Cassation quashed the Istanbul Assize Court’s judgment for having erred in its assessment of the facts. The case was remitted to the Istanbul Assize Court for re-trial.

Between 12 May 2006 and 30 May 2007 the Istanbul Assize Court held six hearings and dealt with procedural issues, such as the delivery of arrest warrants, the appointment of advocates for some of the accused and the extension of time-limits for defence submissions, etc.

On 21 May 2008 the Istanbul Assize Court delivered its judgment in respect of the applicant and thirteen other co-accused who stood trial for actively participating in the illegal activities of the TKP/ML – TIKKO with a view to undermining the constitutional order of the State. Having established that the applicant had been involved in armed attacks, the killing of several individuals and robberies, the court found the applicant guilty of the alleged offence and sentenced him to life imprisonment, pursuant to Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code. The applicant appealed.

The proceedings are currently pending before the Court of Cassation.","{'applicant': 'Fedai Şahin', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-89184

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1961 and lives in Istanbul.

On 3 September 2001 an arrest warrant was issued by the Izmir Criminal Court in respect of the applicant due to his alleged involvement in fraud and the forgery of identity cards.

On 13 August 2001 the Izmir Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment charging the applicant with these offences under Article 350 (1), (2) and (3) of the former Criminal Code.

On 12 October 2001 the Bakırköy Magistrates' Court ordered the applicant's detention on remand in accordance with the arrest warrant.

On 10 December 2001 the Izmir Criminal Court issued a decision of lack of jurisdiction and referred the case to the Izmir Assize Court.

On 11 December 2001 the applicant was heard by the Bakırköy Magistrates' Court upon the instruction of the Izmir Criminal Court. The applicant pleaded not guilty and requested his release.

Between 19 December 2001 and 3 February 2003, the first-instance court postponed nine hearings since the applicant, who was detained in the Metris Prison, was not brought before it as he could not be transferred to the Buca Prison in Izmir.

Between 19 December 2001 and 7 July 2003, the Izmir Assize Court examined the applicant's continued detention at the end of every hearing, either of its own motion or upon the applicant's requests. On each occasion, the court ordered the applicant's continued detention, having regard to the state of the evidence and nature of the offence. On 7 July 2003 the court ordered the applicant's release.

On 8 November 2004 the applicant was acquitted for lack of evidence.

On 10 February 2005 the applicant brought an action before the Bakırköy Assize Court requesting compensation for his unjustified detention.

On 8 October 2007, the Bakırköy Assize Court partially granted the applicant's compensation claim.

On 20 November 2008 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of 8 October 2007.

According to the information in the case file, the compensation proceedings are currently pending before the first instance court.","{'applicant': 'Zehni Doğan', 'articles': [91, 34, 53, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2010}",001-97110

The case originated in an application (no. 1520/06) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Osman Erden (“the applicant”), on 30 December 2005. The applicant was represented by Ms B. Baysal, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

On 18 June 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Bartın.

On 13 January 1982 the applicant, a primary school teacher in Kahramanmaraş at the material time, was discharged from his duties and on 10 March 1989 he was reinstated.

The applicant subsequently requested the Ministry of Education (“the Ministry”) to reimburse him for the salaries and other financial rights he had been unfairly deprived of during the period of inactivity. The Ministry rejected this request.

The applicant lodged an action before the Ankara Administrative Court, requesting this court to quash the Ministry's decision and to order the payment of his entitlements.

On 6 November 1991 the Ankara Administrative Court partially granted the applicant's request and ordered the calculation and payment of the applicant's salaries and other financial benefits, solely for the period falling between 15 March 1985 and 10 March 1989. The administrative court did not order payment of interest on the relevant amount.

On 16 April 1992 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court.

Following the final decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the applicant petitioned the Ministry on numerous occasions for the execution of the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court and the payment of his money.

On 14 January 2001 the applicant applied to the Ankara Administrative Court, requesting the clarification (tavzih) of its decision dated 6 November 1991. The applicant asked the court to declare, in particular, the exact amount that he was entitled to receive from the Ministry. He explained that without this information, he could not request the enforcement of the impugned judgment by execution offices.

On 20 March 2002 the Ankara Administrative Court rejected the applicant's request for clarification.

On 30 June 2005 the applicant was paid 4.35 Turkish liras (TRY0)0, which corresponded to the salaries and other financial benefits he would have received during the specified period of his discharge. The applicant was not paid any default interest on this amount to compensate the effects of inflation, pursuant to the instructions of the Ministry of Finance dated 24 May 2005 and the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court dated 6 November 1991.","{'applicant': 'Osman Erden', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2010}",001-101444
86,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 48843/99) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Graham Cooper (“the applicant”), on 8 June 1999.

The applicant was represented by Mr G. Blades, a solicitor practising in Lincoln. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mr C. Whomersley and, subsequently, Mr J. Grainger, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant complained that he did not have a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law, in violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. In particular, he complained that the structure of the court-martial that had tried him was such that it violated the independence and impartiality requirements, and consequently the fairness requirement, of that Article. He also complained of unfairness based on the particular facts of his case.

The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 4 June 2002 a Chamber of that Section declared inadmissible the specific complaint of unfairness under Article 6 and gave notice to the Government of his main complaint concerning the independence and impartiality of the court-martial (Rule 54 § 2 (b) of the Rules of Court). On 6 May 2003 a Chamber of that Section (composed of Mr M. Pellonpää, Sir Nicolas Bratza, Mrs V. Strážnicka, Mr R. Maruste, Mr S. Pavlovschi, Mr L. Garlicki, Mr J. Borrego Borrego, judges, and Mr M. O'Boyle, Section Registrar) relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber, neither of the parties having objected to such relinquishment (Article 30 of the Convention and Rule 72).

The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 27 §§ 2 and 3 of the Convention and Rule 24.

Pursuant to Article 29 § 3 of the Convention and Rule 54A § 3, the Grand Chamber notified the parties that it might decide to examine the merits of the complaint before it at the same time as its admissibility and decided to put an additional question to the parties.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the admissibility and merits of the case, together with separate submissions on the applicable domestic law and practice.

A hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 1 October 2003 (Rule 59 § 3). There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr J. Grainger, Agent, Mr P. Havers QC, Counsel, Ms T. Jones, Mr H. Morrison, Mr E. Latham, Air Vice-Marshal R. Charles, Commodore J. Blackett, Commander S. Taylor, Brigadier T. Paphiti, Advisers; (b) for the applicant Mr G. Blades, Solicitor, Representative, Mr J. Mackenzie, Solicitor, Adviser. The Court heard addresses by Mr Havers and Mr Blades.

The Grand Chamber subsequently decided to examine the merits of the complaint before it at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3 of the Convention and Rule 54A § 3).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Birmingham. At the relevant time he was a member of the Royal Air Force (RAF).

On 18 February 1998 the applicant, along with a co-accused, was convicted by a district court-martial (pursuant to section 70(1) of the Air Force Act 1955) of theft contrary to the Theft Act 1968. He was sentenced to fifty-six days' imprisonment, to be dismissed from the service and to be reduced to the ranks.

The applicant's court-martial was composed of a permanent president (Wing Commander Rodgers), two other officers of lower rank (Squadron Leader Borthwick and Flight Lieutenant Winks) and a judge advocate. Wing Commander Rodgers' appointment to the post of permanent president was his last before retirement in September 1998. Although he had been the subject of appraisal reports prior to August 1997, he was not reported on thereafter. The two ordinary members had attended the junior officers' command course in 1993, which included training in disciplinary processes.

By a letter from the reviewing authority dated 3 April 1998, the applicant's representative was informed that neither the findings nor the sentence of the court-martial would be varied. The authority had received advice from the Judge Advocate General.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Birmingham. At the relevant time he was a member of the Royal Air Force (RAF).

On 18 February 1998 the applicant, along with a co-accused, was convicted by a district court-martial (pursuant to section 70(1) of the Air Force Act 1955) of theft contrary to the Theft Act 1968. He was sentenced to fifty-six days' imprisonment, to be dismissed from the service and to be reduced to the ranks.

The applicant's court-martial was composed of a permanent president (Wing Commander Rodgers), two other officers of lower rank (Squadron Leader Borthwick and Flight Lieutenant Winks) and a judge advocate. Wing Commander Rodgers' appointment to the post of permanent president was his last before retirement in September 1998. Although he had been the subject of appraisal reports prior to August 1997, he was not reported on thereafter. The two ordinary members had attended the junior officers' command course in 1993, which included training in disciplinary processes.

By a letter from the reviewing authority dated 3 April 1998, the applicant's representative was informed that neither the findings nor the sentence of the court-martial would be varied. The authority had received advice from the Judge Advocate General.

The applicant's appeal to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court against conviction and sentence was dismissed on 5 February 1999.","{'applicant': 'Graham Cooper', 'articles': [91, 34, 51, 48, 34, 44, 32, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 50, 57, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'GRANDCHAMBER', 'year': 2003}",001-61549
89,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 48843/99) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Graham Cooper (“the applicant”), on 8 June 1999.

The applicant was represented by Mr G. Blades, a solicitor practising in Lincoln. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mr C. Whomersley and, subsequently, Mr J. Grainger, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant complained that he did not have a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law, in violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. In particular, he complained that the structure of the court-martial that had tried him was such that it violated the independence and impartiality requirements, and consequently the fairness requirement, of that Article. He also complained of unfairness based on the particular facts of his case.

The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 4 June 2002 a Chamber of that Section declared inadmissible the specific complaint of unfairness under Article 6 and gave notice to the Government of his main complaint concerning the independence and impartiality of the court-martial (Rule 54 § 2 (b) of the Rules of Court). On 6 May 2003 a Chamber of that Section (composed of Mr M. Pellonpää, Sir Nicolas Bratza, Mrs V. Strážnicka, Mr R. Maruste, Mr S. Pavlovschi, Mr L. Garlicki, Mr J. Borrego Borrego, judges, and Mr M. O'Boyle, Section Registrar) relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber, neither of the parties having objected to such relinquishment (Article 30 of the Convention and Rule 72).

The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 27 §§ 2 and 3 of the Convention and Rule 24.

Pursuant to Article 29 § 3 of the Convention and Rule 54A § 3, the Grand Chamber notified the parties that it might decide to examine the merits of the complaint before it at the same time as its admissibility and decided to put an additional question to the parties.

The case originated in an application (no. 287/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Ferit Çengelli and Mr Süleyman Eryılmaz (“the applicants”), on 23 September 2002.

The applicants were represented by Mr C. Yücel and Mr M. Çelik, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

On 7 May 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicants were born in 1955 and 1957 respectively and live in Istanbul.

On 3 and 15 March 1981 the applicants were arrested.

On 26 May 1981 the Ankara Martial Law Court ordered their detention on remand.

On 16 June 1981 the public prosecutor attached to the Adana Martial Law Court filed a bill of indictment against 343 persons, including the applicants, and charged the latter with membership of an illegal organisation, the Dev-Yol (Devrimci Yol - the Revolutionary Way).

On 17 June 1986 the Adana Martial Law Court convicted the applicants as charged.

On an unspecified date the applicants appealed.

On 20 March 1991 the Military Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court and remitted the case to the Ankara Martial Law Court, since in the meantime the former court had been abolished.

On an unspecified date in 1991 the applicants were released pending trial.

Subsequent to the promulgation of Law no. 3953 on 27 December 1993, which abolished the jurisdiction of the Martial Law Courts, the Ankara Assize Court acquired jurisdiction in the applicants’ case.

On 18 June 2001 the Ankara Assize Court convicted Süleyman Eryılmaz under Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to death. This sentence was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment. Regarding Ferit Çengelli, the first-instance court ordered that the criminal proceedings against him be terminated on the ground that the statutory time‑limit under Articles 102 and 104 of the Criminal Code had expired.

The judgment of the Ankara Assize Court was automatically referred to the Court of Cassation insofar as it concerned Süleyman Eryılmaz, since the latter’s sentence exceeded 15 years’ imprisonment.

On 24 July 2002 the applicants allegedly learned about the outcome of the proceedings before the Ankara Assize Court through a friend.

By a letter dated 7 February 2003, the applicants’ former lawyer informed the Court that the judgment of 18 June 2001 had been served on Ferit Çengelli on 3 February 2003 upon his request, and that the proceedings against Süleyman Eryılmaz were still pending before the Court of Cassation. (From the case file it appears that the State had attempted to serve the judgment on Ferit Çengelli earlier, but had mistakenly sent it to the wrong address.)

According to the documents submitted to the Court by the respondent Government, on 30 October 2003 the Court of Cassation quashed the Ankara Assize Court’s judgment of 18 June 2001 insofar as it concerned Süleyman Eryılmaz and remitted the case to the Ankara Assize Court.

According to the information in the case file, the case against Süleyman Eryılmaz is still pending before the Ankara Assize Court.","{'applicant': 'Ferit Çengelli', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-86867

On 18 June 2001 the Ankara Assize Court convicted Süleyman Eryılmaz under Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to death. This sentence was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment. Regarding Ferit Çengelli, the first-instance court ordered that the criminal proceedings against him be terminated on the ground that the statutory time‑limit under Articles 102 and 104 of the Criminal Code had expired.

The judgment of the Ankara Assize Court was automatically referred to the Court of Cassation insofar as it concerned Süleyman Eryılmaz, since the latter’s sentence exceeded 15 years’ imprisonment.

On 24 July 2002 the applicants allegedly learned about the outcome of the proceedings before the Ankara Assize Court through a friend.

By a letter dated 7 February 2003, the applicants’ former lawyer informed the Court that the judgment of 18 June 2001 had been served on Ferit Çengelli on 3 February 2003 upon his request, and that the proceedings against Süleyman Eryılmaz were still pending before the Court of Cassation. (From the case file it appears that the State had attempted to serve the judgment on Ferit Çengelli earlier, but had mistakenly sent it to the wrong address.)

According to the documents submitted to the Court by the respondent Government, on 30 October 2003 the Court of Cassation quashed the Ankara Assize Court’s judgment of 18 June 2001 insofar as it concerned Süleyman Eryılmaz and remitted the case to the Ankara Assize Court.

According to the information in the case file, the case against Süleyman Eryılmaz is still pending before the Ankara Assize Court.","{'applicant': 'Ferit Çengelli', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-86867
96,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 55954/00) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Ms Suna Akar and Mr Erdal Beçet (“the applicants”), on 30 December 1999.

The applicants were represented by Mr F.N. Ertekin and Mr. T. Ayçık, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

On 28 September 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the applicants’ right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). The case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicants were born in 1971 and 1975 respectively and live in Istanbul.

On 11 March 1996 the Küçükyalı Police Station was informed that a poster with a bomb had been hung over the Küçükyalı Bridge. Following their arrival at the bridge, the police found a cloth-poster of 2x1 metres on which it was written “We have and will demand the account of Gazi, MLKP0”, (Gazinin hesabını sorduk, soracağız, MLKP). According to the police report, the box looked as if it contained a bomb. However, it did not.

On 12 March 1996 the first applicant was arrested and taken into police custody on suspicion of her involvement in the hanging of the poster. On 19 March 1996 she was brought before the public prosecutor’s office at the Istanbul State Security Court and before the Istanbul State Security Court. The court remanded her in custody.

On 12 June 1996 the second applicant was arrested and taken into police custody on suspicion of his involvement in the above-mentioned incident. On 18 June 1996 he was brought to the public prosecutor’s office at the Istanbul State Security Court and before Istanbul the State Security Court. The court remanded him in custody.

On 26 March 1996 and 20 June 1996 respectively, the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment with that court accusing the applicants of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, namely the MLKP. The public prosecutor requested that the applicants be convicted and sentenced under Article 169 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of Law no. 3713.

On 1 April 1996 the Istanbul State Security Court commenced the trial of the first applicant together with other co-accused.

On an unspecified date, the first and second applicants’ case files were joined and they were tried before the Istanbul State Security Court along with four other suspects accused of the same offence.

On 23 October 1997 the Istanbul State Security Court, relying on the statements given by the applicants and the other suspects to the police, the public prosecutor and the court, convicted the applicants as charged and sentenced them to three years and nine months’ imprisonment.

Following a hearing held on 21 June 1999, the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants’ appeal and upheld the judgment of the Istanbul State Security Court. On 21 July 1999 the judgment of the Court of Cassation was deposited with the registry of the Istanbul State Security Court.","{'applicant': 'Suna Akar', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 51, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 50, 57, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2005}",001-70179

The case originated in two applications (nos. 31706/10 and 33088/10) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr İhsan Güler and Mr Sinan Uğur (“the applicants”), on 5 May 2010 and 13 May 2010 respectively.

The applicants were represented by Mr C. Kayhan, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

Before the Court, the applicants alleged, in particular, that their conviction for propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation, which had been based, in their view, on their participation in a commemorative religious ceremony, had entailed a violation of Article 9 of the Convention.

On 21 November 2011 notice of the applications was given to the Government.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

Mr İhsan Güler and Mr Sinan Uğur were born in 1964 and 1947 respectively and live in Ankara and İzmir respectively.

At the relevant time they were active members and regional leaders of the Party for a Democratic Society (Demokratik Toplum Partisi (DTP)), which was subsequently dissolved by the Constitutional Court. The applicant Mr Güler, former mayor of the district of Başkale (Van), was at the relevant time the chairman of an association called KÜRT-DER (Kürt Demokrasi Kültür ve Dayanışma Derneği – association for Kurdish culture, democracy and solidarity).

On 21 August 2006 the applicants took part in a religious ceremony (mevlût)0 on the premises of the DTP in Altındağ (Ankara), in which they paid tribute to three members of the PKK who had been killed by the security forces.

The participants read out passages from the Koran and said prayers, and showed a film about the lives of the deceased. The DTP’s regional representative gave a short speech, which can be summarised as follows: “Our fears and worries continue. People are still being killed. In such a context, we would like this mevlût to be a moment of peace and fraternity.”

On 3 October 2006 the Muş public prosecutor’s office received an anonymous letter of denunciation, together with a CD containing a recording of the ceremony in question. The writer, who said that he had been a participant himself but had subsequently regretted it, explained that the ceremony had been held in memory of “the martyrs of the PKK”.

Following an investigation by the public prosecutor’s office, the applicant Mr Güler was arrested and taken into police custody on 28 December 2006. He was released the next day.

Both applicants were committed to stand trial before the Ankara Assize Court. In their defence they stated that they had taken part in the ceremony for the observance of their religious duties.

In a judgment of 24 September 2008 the Ankara Assize Court, relying on section 7(2) of Law no. 3713 on the prevention of terrorism, sentenced the two applicants to ten months’ imprisonment.

In its judgment, the Assize Court observed, firstly, that the persons in whose memory the ceremony had been held were members of a terrorist organisation and that they had been killed by the security forces during an operation against that organisation. It also took the view that the choice of venue for the ceremony – the premises of a political party –, and the fact that the PKK flag had been spread over the tables and photos of members of the organisation had been displayed, contributed to raising serious doubts as to the actual reasons for the gathering that had been given by the applicants in their defence.

Further to an appeal on points of law by the applicants, their conviction was upheld by a final judgment of the Court of Cassation on 8 March 2010. The applicants were imprisoned for the duration of their sentence. ...","{'applicant': 'İhsan Güler', 'articles': [91, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 57, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2014}",001-148610

The case originated in an application (no. 13797/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Abdurrazak Suyur, on 27 February 2002.

The applicant was represented before the Court by Mr S. Kurbanoğlu, a lawyer practising in Diyarbakır. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

On 8 July 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of detention on remand, the right to a fair trial by an independent and impartial court within a reasonable time, the right to be presumed innocent and the right to examine witnesses. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.

The applicant filed observations on the merits and admissibility on a timely basis (Rule 59 § 1). The Government submitted their observations outside the time limit. They have therefore not been admitted to the case file.

On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section (Rule 52 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

On 26 April 1993 the applicant was taken into custody in Marmaris by police officers from the Muğla Security Department on suspicion of membership of a terrorist organisation, and he was held in custody until 21 May 1993.

On 21 May 1993 the Siirt Civil Court of First Instance ordered the applicant’s detention on remand.

On 8 June 1993 the Public Prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court filed a bill of indictment accusing the applicant of membership of an illegal terrorist organisation and aiding and abetting the said organization, contrary to Article 125 of the Turkish Criminal Code.

On 16 June 1993 the Diyarbakır State Security Court commenced the trial against the applicant and two other suspects and prolonged the applicant’s detention.

The State Security Court considered the applicant’s continued detention on 58 occasions, either on its own motion or upon the applicant’s request. On each occasion, the applicant’s continued detention was ordered having regard to the nature of the offence, the state of evidence and the content of the file.

On 27 December 2001, after holding 58 hearings, the Diyarbakır State Security Court convicted the applicant under Article 146 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to death, since commuted to life imprisonment.

On 10 July 2002, upon the applicant’s appeal, the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the State Security Court.","{'applicant': 'Abdurrazak Suyur', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 50, 57, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2006}",001-75466

The applicants were represented by Mr A. Özçelik and Mr M. Okutan, lawyers practising in Gaziantep. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

On 16 September 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES

The applicants were born in 1956 and 1946 respectively and live in İslahiye, Gaziantep.

1. The first set of proceedings

Each of the applicants, who were employees of the İslahiye Municipality, brought proceedings before the İslahiye Civil Court of First Instance acting as a labour court, claiming unpaid wages and other pecuniary rights on 10 October 2001 and 21 November 2001, respectively.

On 21 May 2004 and 23 May 2003, respectively, the İslahiye Civil Court of First Instance granted the applicants’ requests partially and ordered the payment of 14,288 Turkish Liras (TRY)0 to the first applicant and TRY 18,5140 to the second applicant, together with interest. These judgments became final as no appeal was filed against them.

The first applicant further initiated execution proceedings before the İslahiye Execution Office to obtain the amount ordered by the İslahiye Civil Court of First Instance (file no. 2005/8415).

At the date of introduction of the applications, the aforementioned judgment debts were still outstanding.

2. The second set of proceedings

On 14 November 2002 and 14 September 2002, respectively, the applicants retired from their jobs at the İslahiye Municipality. The town council calculated the applicants’ severance benefits accordingly.

On 18 March 2003, not having been paid the amounts awarded, the applicants brought proceedings before the İslahiye Civil Court of First Instance acting as a labour court, claiming severance benefits and other pecuniary rights.

On 15 July 2004 the labour court ordered the Municipality to pay TRY 11,9180 to the first applicant and TRY 12,1190 to the second applicant, together with interest. These judgments became final as no appeal was filed against them.

The applicants further initiated execution proceedings before the İslahiye Execution Office to obtain those amounts ordered by the İslahiye Civil Court of First Instance (file nos. 2004/351 and 2004/352).

At the date of introduction of the applications, the aforementioned judgment debts were still outstanding.","{'applicant': 'Mahmut Güler', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2011}",001-105006
102,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 36124/06) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Swedish national, Mr Ralf Gunnar Olsby (“the applicant”), on 23 August 2006.

The applicant was represented by Mr P. Cronhult, a lawyer practising in Stockholm. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms I. Kalmerborn, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

The applicant alleged that he had been deprived of effective access to court in contravention of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

On 30 September 2008 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).

On 1 February 2011 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1 of the Rules of Court) and the above application was assigned to the newly composed Fifth Section.

The Government submitted a unilateral declaration which did not offer sufficient basis for finding that respect for human rights as defined in Article 37 § 1 the Convention had been fulfilled (Prencipe v. Monaco, no. 43376/06, §§ 62-63, 16 July 2009). The Court was therefore required to continue the examination of the case.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Sundbyberg.

By letter dated 9 August 2005, the Enforcement Authority (Kronofogdemyndigheten) informed the applicant that its representative would come to his home on 17 August 2005 to attach property to secure his tax debts amounting to SEK 979,503 (approximately EUR 110,000). It noted that he had previously been informed about his debts but that, since he had not paid, an attachment would be carried out. It is not known when the letter was sent or when the applicant received it.

On 19 August 2005 the Enforcement Authority attached SEK 9,128 (approximately EUR 950) from a bank account belonging to the applicant. A document called Proof of Attachment (bevis om utmätning) was sent to the applicant confirming this and advising him how to go about appealing against the decision and that this had to be done within three weeks from the date that the decision was served on him. The applicant, who was on holiday at the time, did not receive the Proof of Attachment until he returned home on 8 September 2005 and was formally served the decision.

In a decision of 24 August 2005 the Enforcement Authority distributed and paid the attached money to the creditor, in this case, the State itself. The decision was open to appeal within three weeks from the date of the decision.

On 20 September 2005 the applicant requested the Enforcement Authority to rectify (besluta om rättelse) the decision concerning attachment as he considered it to be incorrect. The Enforcement Authority, in a decision of the same day, rejected the applicant’s request for rectification on the ground that it had been submitted too late. It further stated that it was not possible to appeal against the decision in that part and that, as regarded its other decisions, appeals were possible within the time-frames of which the applicant had previously been notified.

On 22 September 2005 the applicant appealed against the attachment decision to the District Court (tingsrätten) of Stockholm. He mainly objected that the Enforcement Authority had not sufficiently taken into account, and made deductions for, the need to cover his basic living expenses.

In a comment (yttrande) by the Enforcement Authority in connection with the appeal, it stated that the appeal had been made within the stated time-limit but that, since the decision as regards the distribution and payment of the funds had gained legal force, the applicant’s appeal could not be tried by the court.

On 19 October 2005 the District Court dismissed the appeal after first having noted that the decision as regarded the payment of the attached funds had gained legal force on 15 September 2005 and that the applicant had appealed against the attachment decision on 22 September 2005. Thereafter the court, with reference to case-law from the Supreme Court, stated that an appeal against an attachment decision that was lodged after a decision regarding the payment of the attached funds had gained legal force could not be considered by the court.

The applicant appealed against the decision to the Svea Court of Appeal (hovrätten) requesting that it quash the lower court’s decision. The applicant submitted that he had not been aware of the attachment decision until 8 September 2005, when he was formally served the Proof of Attachment, and that he had never been notified of the fact that the Enforcement Authority, five days after the attachment decision, had distributed and paid the attached money. In his view, it should not have been permitted to distribute attached money until the actual attachment decision had gained legal force.

On 16 December 2005 the Court of Appeal upheld the District Court’s decision in full.

The applicant appealed to the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen) which, on 28 February 2006, refused leave to appeal.","{'applicant': 'Ralf Gunnar Olsby', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2012}",001-111540

The Enforcement Authority, in a decision of the same day, rejected the applicant’s request for rectification on the ground that it had been submitted too late. It further stated that it was not possible to appeal against the decision in that part and that, as regarded its other decisions, appeals were possible within the time-frames of which the applicant had previously been notified.

On 22 September 2005 the applicant appealed against the attachment decision to the District Court (tingsrätten) of Stockholm. He mainly objected that the Enforcement Authority had not sufficiently taken into account, and made deductions for, the need to cover his basic living expenses.

In a comment (yttrande) by the Enforcement Authority in connection with the appeal, it stated that the appeal had been made within the stated time-limit but that, since the decision as regards the distribution and payment of the funds had gained legal force, the applicant’s appeal could not be tried by the court.

On 19 October 2005 the District Court dismissed the appeal after first having noted that the decision as regarded the payment of the attached funds had gained legal force on 15 September 2005 and that the applicant had appealed against the attachment decision on 22 September 2005. Thereafter the court, with reference to case-law from the Supreme Court, stated that an appeal against an attachment decision that was lodged after a decision regarding the payment of the attached funds had gained legal force could not be considered by the court.

The applicant appealed against the decision to the Svea Court of Appeal (hovrätten) requesting that it quash the lower court’s decision. The applicant submitted that he had not been aware of the attachment decision until 8 September 2005, when he was formally served the Proof of Attachment, and that he had never been notified of the fact that the Enforcement Authority, five days after the attachment decision, had distributed and paid the attached money. In his view, it should not have been permitted to distribute attached money until the actual attachment decision had gained legal force.

On 16 December 2005 the Court of Appeal upheld the District Court’s decision in full.

The applicant appealed to the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen) which, on 28 February 2006, refused leave to appeal.","{'applicant': 'Ralf Gunnar Olsby', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2012}",001-111540
104,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 36124/06) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Swedish national, Mr Ralf Gunnar Olsby (“the applicant”), on 23 August 2006.

The applicant was represented by Mr P. Cronhult, a lawyer practising in Stockholm. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms I. Kalmerborn, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

The applicant alleged that he had been deprived of effective access to court in contravention of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

On 30 September 2008 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).

On 1 February 2011 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1 of the Rules of Court) and the above application was assigned to the newly composed Fifth Section.

The Government submitted a unilateral declaration which did not offer sufficient basis for finding that respect for human rights as defined in Article 37 § 1 the Convention had been fulfilled (Prencipe v. Monaco, no. 43376/06, §§ 62-63, 16 July 2009). The Court was therefore required to continue the examination of the case.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Sundbyberg.

By letter dated 9 August 2005, the Enforcement Authority (Kronofogdemyndigheten) informed the applicant that its representative would come to his home on 17 August 2005 to attach property to secure his tax debts amounting to SEK 979,503 (approximately EUR 110,000). It noted that he had previously been informed about his debts but that, since he had not paid, an attachment would be carried out. It is not known when the letter was sent or when the applicant received it.

On 19 August 2005 the Enforcement Authority attached SEK 9,128 (approximately EUR 950) from a bank account belonging to the applicant. A document called Proof of Attachment (bevis om utmätning) was sent to the applicant confirming this and advising him how to go about appealing against the decision and that this had to be done within three weeks from the date that the decision was served on him. The applicant, who was on holiday at the time, did not receive the Proof of Attachment until he returned home on 8 September 2005 and was formally served the decision.

The case originated in an application (no. 49398/99) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Turkish nationals, Ms Gülizar Pembe, Mr Mıstık Ateş, Mr İsmail Karapınar and Ms Yüksel Bozkaya (“the applicants”), on 14 June 1999.

The applicants were represented by Mr Ş. Ensari and Mr M. Ensari, lawyers practising in İskenderun. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

On 27 May 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning insufficient interest payable in respect of additional compensation, the delay of the authorities in payment of the additional compensation and the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicants were born in 1945, 1935, 1948 and 1938 respectively and live in İskenderun and Belen respectively.

In 1993 the applicants' plots of land in İskenderun were expropriated by the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways. A committee of experts assessed the value of these lands and the determined amounts were paid to them when the expropriation took place.

On 20 August, 10 October and 21 November 1996 respectively, the applicants filed separate actions for compensation with the İskenderun Civil Court of First Instance.

On 19 September 1997 the first-instance court ordered the administration to pay Mıstık Ateş 41,410,845,000 Turkish liras (TRL) plus interest at the statutory rate, running from 7 August 1996, the date on which the ownership of the property was transferred to the National Water Board.

On 25 September 1997 the first-instance court ordered the administration to pay Gülizar Pembe TRL 6,467,500,000 plus interest at the statutory rate, running from 11 September 1996, the date on which the ownership of the property was transferred to the National Water Board.

On the same day, the first-instance court ordered the administration to pay Yüksel Bozkaya TRL 80,274,368,000 plus interest at the statutory rate, running from 23 October 1996, the date on which the ownership of the property was transferred to the National Water Board.

On 7 October 1997 the first-instance court ordered the administration to pay İsmail Karapınar TRL 13,075,000,000 plus interest at the statutory rate, running from 11 September 1996, the date on which the ownership of the property was transferred to the National Water Board.

The Court of Cassation upheld the above-mentioned judgments of the İskenderun First Instance Court on 11 May, 20 May and 25 May 1998 respectively.

The case originated in an application (no. 30316/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Hilmi İzmirli (“the applicant”), on 11 June 2002.

The applicant was represented by Mrs O. Ersoy, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

The applicant complained of a violation of his right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.

On 12 September 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Istanbul.

On 16 October 1981, at a time when Turkey was ruled by martial law following the military “coup” of 12 September 1980, the applicant was arrested on suspicion of being a member of an illegal armed organisation, the Dev-Yol (Revolutionary Way).

He was detained for forty-seven days. During his interrogation, which allegedly involved ill-treatment, he confessed to having been involved in various illegal activities of the Dev-Yol. On 2 December 1981 the Ankara Martial Law Court (Sıkıyönetim Mahkemesi) ordered his detention on remand and transferred him to the Mamak Military Prison.

On 26 February 1982 the Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Martial Law Court against the applicant and 722 other defendants. The prosecutor accused the applicant, inter alia, of membership of the Dev-Yol, whose aim was to undermine the constitutional order and replace it with a Marxist-Leninist regime. The prosecution sought the death penalty under Article 146 § 1 of the – then in force – Criminal Code.

In a judgment of 13 March 1985, the Martial Law Court convicted the applicant of membership of the Dev-Yol. It sentenced him to five years' imprisonment under Article 168 § 2 of the Criminal Code. One of the judges dissented, opining that the evidence against the applicant was insufficient.

Both the defendants and the prosecutor appealed to the Military Court of Cassation. While the appeal was pending, the applicant was released from prison on 14 November 1988.

In the meantime, martial law was terminated. Following the promulgation of the Law of 27 December 1993 abolishing the jurisdiction of the martial law courts, the Court of Cassation (Yargıtay) acquired jurisdiction over the case.

On 27 December 1995 the Court of Cassation quashed the applicant's conviction. It re-qualified the offence under Article 146 § 1 of the Turkish Criminal Code, which entailed a more severe sentence. It transmitted the case to the Ankara Assize Court, which held its first hearing on 6 May 1996.

On 16 July 2002 the Assize Court handed down its verdict on the applicant and numerous other accused.

On 28 May 2004, however, the Court of Cassation quashed the verdict, holding that the court should have taken into account some recent legislative amendments affecting the situation of some of the accused including the applicant. It remitted the case to the assize court, before which the proceedings are still pending.

On 3 October 2006 the Ankara Assize Court convicted the applicant, under Article 146 § 1 of the Turkish Criminal Code, of attempting to undermine the constitutional order and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The applicant appealed against this judgment and the proceedings are still pending before the Court of Cassation.","{'applicant': 'Hilmi İzmirli', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2007}",001-81191

The case originated in an application (no. 47114/99) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Sean Marc Taylor-Sabori (“the applicant”), on 1 October 1998.

The applicant, was granted legal aid, but never actually claimed it. He was represented by Bobbetts Mackan, a firm of solicitors practising in Bristol. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C.A. Whomersley, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant complains, principally, under Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention that the interception of his pager messages by the police and subsequent reference to them at his trial amounted to an unjustified interference with his private life and correspondence which was not “in accordance with the law” and in respect of which there was no remedy under English law.

The application was originally allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.

On 27 June 2000 the Court declared the applicant’s complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention inadmissible. On 29 May 2001 it declared his complaints under Articles 8 and 13 admissible. The Court decided, after consulting the parties, to dispense with a hearing (Rule 59 § 2 in fine).

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.

Between August 1995 and the applicant’s arrest on 21 January 1996, he was the target of surveillance by the police. Using a “clone” of the applicant’s pager, the police were able to intercept messages sent to him. The pager system used by the applicant and intercepted by the police operated as follows: The sender, whether in the United Kingdom or overseas, would telephone the pager bureau in the United Kingdom via the public telephone network. The pager operator would key the message into a computer and read it back to the sender to confirm its accuracy. The computer message was transmitted via the public telephone system to the pager terminal, from where it was relayed by radio to one of four regional base stations and thence, again by radio, simultaneously to the applicant’s and the police’s clone pagers, which displayed the message in text.

The applicant was arrested and charged with conspiracy to supply a controlled drug. The prosecution alleged that he had been one of the principal organisers of the importation to the United Kingdom from Amsterdam of over 22,000 ecstasy tablets worth approximately GBP 268,000. He was tried, along with a number of alleged co-conspirators, at Bristol Crown Court in September 1997.

Part of the prosecution case against the applicant consisted of the contemporaneous written notes of the pager messages which had been transcribed by the police. The applicant’s counsel submitted that these notes should not be admitted in evidence because the police had not had a warrant under section 2 of the Interception of Communications Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) for the interception of the pager messages. However, the trial judge ruled that, since the messages had been transmitted via a private system, the 1985 Act did not apply and no warrant had been necessary.

The applicant pleaded not guilty. He was convicted and sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment.

The applicant appealed against conviction and sentence. One of the grounds was the admission in evidence of the pager messages. The Court of Appeal, dismissing the appeal on 13 September 1998, upheld the trial judge’s ruling that the messages had been intercepted at the point of transmission on the private radio system, so that the 1985 Act did not apply and the messages were admissible despite having been intercepted without a warrant.","{'applicant': 'Sean Marc Taylor-Sabori', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2002}",001-60696

Using a “clone” of the applicant’s pager, the police were able to intercept messages sent to him. The pager system used by the applicant and intercepted by the police operated as follows: The sender, whether in the United Kingdom or overseas, would telephone the pager bureau in the United Kingdom via the public telephone network. The pager operator would key the message into a computer and read it back to the sender to confirm its accuracy. The computer message was transmitted via the public telephone system to the pager terminal, from where it was relayed by radio to one of four regional base stations and thence, again by radio, simultaneously to the applicant’s and the police’s clone pagers, which displayed the message in text.

The applicant was arrested and charged with conspiracy to supply a controlled drug. The prosecution alleged that he had been one of the principal organisers of the importation to the United Kingdom from Amsterdam of over 22,000 ecstasy tablets worth approximately GBP 268,000. He was tried, along with a number of alleged co-conspirators, at Bristol Crown Court in September 1997.

Part of the prosecution case against the applicant consisted of the contemporaneous written notes of the pager messages which had been transcribed by the police. The applicant’s counsel submitted that these notes should not be admitted in evidence because the police had not had a warrant under section 2 of the Interception of Communications Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) for the interception of the pager messages. However, the trial judge ruled that, since the messages had been transmitted via a private system, the 1985 Act did not apply and no warrant had been necessary.

The applicant pleaded not guilty. He was convicted and sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment.

The applicant appealed against conviction and sentence. One of the grounds was the admission in evidence of the pager messages. The Court of Appeal, dismissing the appeal on 13 September 1998, upheld the trial judge’s ruling that the messages had been intercepted at the point of transmission on the private radio system, so that the 1985 Act did not apply and the messages were admissible despite having been intercepted without a warrant.","{'applicant': 'Sean Marc Taylor-Sabori', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2002}",001-60696

The case originated in an application (no. 47114/99) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Sean Marc Taylor-Sabori (“the applicant”), on 1 October 1998.

The applicant, was granted legal aid, but never actually claimed it. He was represented by Bobbetts Mackan, a firm of solicitors practising in Bristol. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C.A. Whomersley, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant complains, principally, under Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention that the interception of his pager messages by the police and subsequent reference to them at his trial amounted to an unjustified interference with his private life and correspondence which was not “in accordance with the law” and in respect of which there was no remedy under English law.

The application was originally allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.

On 27 June 2000 the Court declared the applicant’s complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention inadmissible. On 29 May 2001 it declared his complaints under Articles 8 and 13 admissible. The Court decided, after consulting the parties, to dispense with a hearing (Rule 59 § 2 in fine).

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section.

The case originated in an application (no. 23815/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Abdülkadir Uslu (“the applicant”), on 13 May 2004.

The applicant was represented by Ms Ö. Uslu, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

On 29 November 2007 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Istanbul. He was detained at the Inebolu prison at the time of the events.

Upon the applicant’s request he was examined by a doctor at the prison clinic on 14 January 2004.

According to the prison clinic’s registry provided by the Government, the applicant was examined by the prison doctor who considered that he was suffering from a tension headache. The doctor decided to transfer the applicant to a neurology department of a hospital. The Government submitted that, since there was no neurology department at Inebolu State Hospital, the applicant was transferred to Kastamonu State Hospital where he was examined by a doctor at the Neurology Department on 25 March 2004.

In the meantime, on 19 January 2004 the applicant filed a petition with the Inebolu Judge for the Execution of Sentences, after an oral refusal by the prison authorities, requesting copies of the doctor’s report issued after his medical examination of 14 January 2004 and the relevant pages of the prison clinic’s registry.

On 21 January 2004 the Inebolu Judge of Execution ordered the prison authorities to provide the applicant with copies of the requested documents. The applicant was so provided.

On 26 January 2004 the Inebolu public prosecutor filed an objection against the above decision. Referring to the spirit and purpose of a circular dated 5 December 1990, he claimed, inter alia, that the delivery of the originals or copies of any official prison documents to detainees or convicted persons was not permitted, in practice, on grounds of security and public order.

On 27 January 2004 the Inebolu Assize Court accepted the prosecutor’s objection on these grounds.

On 30 January 2004 the documents in question were reclaimed by the prison authorities.

On 29 March 2004, the applicant requested the prison authorities to provide him with a copy of the medical report and prescription issued at the Kastamonu State Hospital following his medical examination on 25 March 2004. On the same day he received them.

The applicant’s further request from the Ministry of Justice to quash the Assize Court’s judgment by a written order (yazılı emir) was also rejected on 4 May 2004.

On 26 November 2004 the applicant was released from prison.","{'applicant': 'Abdülkadir Uslu', 'articles': [91, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2009}",001-90710

The case originated in an application (no. 63480/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr John Henry Hubley (“the applicant”), on 29 September 2000. By a letter of 11 June 2007 the applicant’s estate informed the Registry that the applicant had passed away and that the estate intended to continue these proceedings.

The applicant was represented by Ms P. Glynn, a lawyer practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

By a partial decision of 10 September 2002 the Court decided to adjourn the applicant’s complaint in connection with his claims for widows’ benefits, relating to discrimination suffered by him during the period after the date on which he lodged his claim for widows’ benefits, to adjourn the applicant’s complaint concerning Widow’s Bereavement Allowance and to declare the remainder of the application inadmissible.

Subsequently, under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, the Chamber to which the case had been allocated, decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Leeds.

His wife died on 19 March 1997. The couple had two children, born in 1981 and 1984 respectively.

In May 2000 the applicant enquired about widow’s benefits. On 17 May 2000 the Benefits Agency informed him that there was at that time no legislation providing an equivalent of the widows’ benefits concerned to widowers. He was told that he had no right of appeal since his claim had not been considered by a decision-maker.

On 19 May 2000 the applicant asked for the matter to be considered by a decision-maker.

On 20 May 2000 the applicant applied for benefits equivalent to those to which a widow, whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of his wife, would have been entitled, namely a Widow’s Payment, a Widowed Mother’s Allowance and thereafter a Widow’s Pension, payable under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”). On 26 May 2000 the benefits agency refused the applicant’s claim because he was not a woman, but informed him that he was entitled to appeal.

On 11 June 2000 the applicant appealed. On 15 June 2000 the decision maker reconsidered the decision and upheld the previous decision. The applicant appealed this decision. On 27 September 2000 the Social Security Appeals Service dismissed the applicant’s appeal.

On 6 October 2000 the applicant made a claim for Widow’s Bereavement Tax Allowance (“WBA”) to the Inland Revenue for the years 1996-1998. On 25 October 2000 he was informed that his claim could not be accepted because there was no basis in domestic law allowing widowers to claim this benefit.

The applicant received child benefit in the sum of GBP 70.20 per month.","{'applicant': 'John Henry Hubley', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-87407

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Leeds.

His wife died on 19 March 1997. The couple had two children, born in 1981 and 1984 respectively.

In May 2000 the applicant enquired about widow’s benefits. On 17 May 2000 the Benefits Agency informed him that there was at that time no legislation providing an equivalent of the widows’ benefits concerned to widowers. He was told that he had no right of appeal since his claim had not been considered by a decision-maker.

On 19 May 2000 the applicant asked for the matter to be considered by a decision-maker.

On 20 May 2000 the applicant applied for benefits equivalent to those to which a widow, whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of his wife, would have been entitled, namely a Widow’s Payment, a Widowed Mother’s Allowance and thereafter a Widow’s Pension, payable under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”). On 26 May 2000 the benefits agency refused the applicant’s claim because he was not a woman, but informed him that he was entitled to appeal.

On 11 June 2000 the applicant appealed. On 15 June 2000 the decision maker reconsidered the decision and upheld the previous decision. The applicant appealed this decision. On 27 September 2000 the Social Security Appeals Service dismissed the applicant’s appeal.

On 6 October 2000 the applicant made a claim for Widow’s Bereavement Tax Allowance (“WBA”) to the Inland Revenue for the years 1996-1998. On 25 October 2000 he was informed that his claim could not be accepted because there was no basis in domestic law allowing widowers to claim this benefit.

The applicant received child benefit in the sum of GBP 70.20 per month.","{'applicant': 'John Henry Hubley', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-87407

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Leeds.

His wife died on 19 March 1997. The couple had two children, born in 1981 and 1984 respectively.

In May 2000 the applicant enquired about widow’s benefits. On 17 May 2000 the Benefits Agency informed him that there was at that time no legislation providing an equivalent of the widows’ benefits concerned to widowers. He was told that he had no right of appeal since his claim had not been considered by a decision-maker.

On 19 May 2000 the applicant asked for the matter to be considered by a decision-maker.

On 20 May 2000 the applicant applied for benefits equivalent to those to which a widow, whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of his wife, would have been entitled, namely a Widow’s Payment, a Widowed Mother’s Allowance and thereafter a Widow’s Pension, payable under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”). On 26 May 2000 the benefits agency refused the applicant’s claim because he was not a woman, but informed him that he was entitled to appeal.

On 11 June 2000 the applicant appealed. On 15 June 2000 the decision maker reconsidered the decision and upheld the previous decision. The applicant appealed this decision. On 27 September 2000 the Social Security Appeals Service dismissed the applicant’s appeal.

On 6 October 2000 the applicant made a claim for Widow’s Bereavement Tax Allowance (“WBA”) to the Inland Revenue for the years 1996-1998. On 25 October 2000 he was informed that his claim could not be accepted because there was no basis in domestic law allowing widowers to claim this benefit.

The applicant received child benefit in the sum of GBP 70.20 per month.","{'applicant': 'John Henry Hubley', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-87407

AS TO THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

In 1979, the applicant, then aged 17, was convicted of murder and sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure. The “tariff” part of the applicant’s sentence, attributable to deterrence and punishment, was set at 8 years and expired in 1987.

Following the expiry of his tariff, the applicant’s case was the subject of review by the Parole Board on a number of occasions. Following the fourth review in January 1991, the applicant absconded from prison. Following his recapture on 6 July 1993 it was decided that his case should be reviewed again in January 1995.

At this, the fifth review, which in fact took place in August 1995, the Parole Board recommended that the applicant be given a provisional release date of 12 months hence, during which time he should spend six months in a Category D open prison, followed by six months in a Pre-Release Employment Scheme Hostel.

The Parole Board’s recommendation was not accepted by the Secretary of State who directed that the applicant be transferred to a Category D prison and his case be subject to further review in 12 months. The applicant was notified of the Secretary of State’s decision and the Parole Board’s recommendation by letter of 17 November 1995. By letter dated 6 December 1995, the applicant made representations against that decision. These were rejected by the Secretary of State by letter dated 2 January 1996.

139,"PROCEDURE

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) and by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (“the Government”) on 19 October 1996 and on 7 January 1997 respectively, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 24839/94) against the United Kingdom lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by Mrs Phyllis Bowman, a British citizen, on 11 March 1994. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 of the Convention and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46). The object of the request and of the Government’s application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 10 of the Convention.

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that she wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent her (Rule 30).

The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 § 4 (b)). On 29 October 1996, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr B. Walsh, Mr C. Russo, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr A.N. Loizou, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha and Mr P. Jambrek (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 5).

As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s representative and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 § 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence and an extension of the time-limit granted at the request of the applicant, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial on 3 June 1997 and the applicant’s memorial on 18 July 1997.

In accordance with the decision of the President, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 27 August 1997. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr D. Bentley, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr D. Pannick QC, Mr D. Anderson, Counsel, Mr R. Clayton, Home Office, Adviser; (b) for the Commission Mr L. Loucaides, Delegate; (c) for the applicant Mr G. Robertson QC, Counsel, Mr D. Price, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr Loucaides, Mr Pannick and Mr Robertson.

Following deliberations held on 29 August 1997 the Chamber decided to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of a Grand Chamber (Rule 51).

The Grand Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr Ryssdal, the President of the Court, and Mr Bernhardt, the Vice-President, together with the other members and substitute judges of the original Chamber, the latter being Mrs E. Palm and Mr J. Casadevall (Rule 51 § 2 (a) and (b)). On 30 August 1997 the President, in the presence of the Registrar, drew by lot the names of the nine additional judges needed to complete the Grand Chamber, namely Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr N. Valticos, Mr A.B. Baka, Mr L. Wildhaber, Mr D. Gotchev, Mr U. Lōhmus, Mr E. Levits and Mr P. van Dijk (Rule 51 § 2 (c)).

Having taken note of the agreement of the Agent of the Government and the concurring opinions of the Delegate of the Commission and of the applicant, the Court decided on 25 October 1997 that it was not necessary to hold a further hearing following the relinquishment of jurisdiction by the Chamber (Rule 38, taken together with Rule 51 § 6).

Subsequently, Mr Bernhardt replaced Mr Ryssdal, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case, as President of the Grand Chamber (Rule 21 § 5).

AS TO THE FACTS

I. THE circumstances of the case

Mrs Phyllis Bowman was born in 1926 and lives in London. She is the executive director of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child (“SPUC”), an organisation of approximately 50,000 members which is opposed to abortion and human embryo experimentation and seeks changes to the present United Kingdom law which permits abortion up to twenty-two weeks and embryo experimentation up to fourteen days.

The major political parties have no policies with regard to abortion and embryo experimentation: these are regarded as moral issues and members of Parliament are allowed to vote on proposed legislation according to their consciences. Mrs Bowman and SPUC therefore took the view that, if electors were to be in a position to bring about changes to the law through their choice of representative, it was important for them to be informed of the opinions of candidates standing for election with regard to abortion and related issues.

In the period immediately before the parliamentary elections in April 1992, Mrs Bowman therefore arranged to have some one and a half million leaflets distributed in constituencies throughout the United Kingdom, including, in the constituency of Halifax, 25,000 copies of a leaflet which read as follows: “We are not telling you how to vote, but it is essential for you to check on Candidates’ voting intentions on abortion and on the use of the human embryo as a guinea-pig. Terry Martin, Conservative. Mr Martin has publicly declared his firm commitment to defending the unborn child. If elected, he would vote to tighten the grounds for abortion to stop abortion on demand. He would vote to stop abortion after 24 weeks, as the law currently allows abortion up to birth for handicapped babies and on other grounds. Would vote to stop the creation and use of human embryos as guinea-pigs for drug testing. Alison Mahon, Labour. Mrs Mahon is a leading pro-abortionist. As an MP she voted to allow abortion up to birth for handicapped babies. She voted for the compulsory enrolment on a published register of doctors with a conscientious objection to abortion despite warnings that it could be used as a blacklist. She also voted to allow human embryos to be used as guinea-pigs in programmes including the testing of drugs and other experiments. Ian Howell, Liberal Democrat. If elected, Mr Howell would vote for the tightening of the grounds for abortion to stop abortion on demand. He would vote to reduce the time-limit to 24 weeks or less, where the law currently allows abortion up to birth for handicapped babies and on other grounds. He would vote to protect human embryos from being used as guinea‑pigs in research programmes. THE SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE UNBORN CHILD” On the reverse side of the leaflet, together with a picture marked “an unborn baby ten weeks after conception”, was printed: “The First Weeks of Life Day 1: Conception – sperm and ovum meet in fertilisation. Genetic make-up complete. Colour of eyes, hair, sex and even build determined. A unique individual is present in the womb’s fallopian tube. Day 12: Has travelled to the womb and implanted there. Day 17: Development of own blood cells. Day 21: Heart starts to beat. This is at least as dramatic as birth, but far less dramatic than fertilisation. Day 26: Foundation of central nervous system established. Day 30: Regular blood flow within closed vascular system. Ears and nose start to develop. Day 42: Skeleton and reflexes present. Liver, kidneys and lungs formed. Responds to touch around the mouth. Day 45: Electrical brainwave patterns can be recorded. Day 56: All organs functioning except the lungs; the baby only has to grow and mature now, just as a child grows into an adult. Day 65: The baby can make a fist and will grasp an object stroking his palm; leaps up and down in the womb with movements co-ordinated. Week 12: Entire surface of the body sensitive to touch. Week 16: Baby is half birth length; the heart pumps 50 pints of blood daily. Week 28: Eyes open. Baby can hear mother’s digestive processes, heartbeat and her voice, as well as sounds outside her body. 9th Month: Birth – just another stage in an already well-advanced process. From the above it is clear that the baby can feel pain at a very early stage. We are, therefore, destroying babies painfully up to 6 months after conception, and in some cases, such as handicap, up to birth.”

Mrs Bowman was charged with an offence under subsections 75(1) and (5) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (“the 1983 Act”), which prohibits expenditure of more than five pounds sterling (“GBP”) by an unauthorised person during the period before an election on conveying information to electors with a view to promoting or procuring the election of a candidate (see paragraphs 17–19 below).

At Mrs Bowman’s trial at Southwark Crown Court on 27 September 1993, the judge directed her acquittal, because the summons charging her with the offence had not been issued within one year of the alleged prohibited expenditure, in accordance with the time-limit stipulated in section 176 of the 1983 Act. The proceedings were, nonetheless, reported in the press.

In 1979, Mrs Bowman had been convicted of an offence under similar legislation in respect of a leaflet distributed prior to the Ilford North by-election and in 1982 she had also been convicted in respect of a leaflet distributed during the elections for the European Parliament. On both occasions she was ordered to pay a fine and the prosecution costs.","{'applicant': 'Phyllis Bowman', 'articles': [91, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 50, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 48, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'GRANDCHAMBER', 'year': 1998}",001-58134

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) and by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (“the Government”) on 19 October 1996 and on 7 January 1997 respectively, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 24839/94) against the United Kingdom lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by Mrs Phyllis Bowman, a British citizen, on 11 March 1994. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 of the Convention and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46). The object of the request and of the Government’s application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 10 of the Convention.

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that she wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent her (Rule 30).

The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R.

As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s representative and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 § 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence and an extension of the time-limit granted at the request of the applicant, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial on 3 June 1997 and the applicant’s memorial on 18 July 1997.

In accordance with the decision of the President, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 27 August 1997. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr D. Bentley, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr D. Pannick QC, Mr D. Anderson, Counsel, Mr R. Clayton, Home Office, Adviser; (b) for the Commission Mr L. Loucaides, Delegate; (c) for the applicant Mr G. Robertson QC, Counsel, Mr D. Price, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr Loucaides, Mr Pannick and Mr Robertson.

Following deliberations held on 29 August 1997 the Chamber decided to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of a Grand Chamber (Rule 51).

The Grand Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr Ryssdal, the President of the Court, and Mr Bernhardt, the Vice-President, together with the other members and substitute judges of the original Chamber, the latter being Mrs E. Palm and Mr J. Casadevall (Rule 51 § 2 (a) and (b)). On 30 August 1997 the President, in the presence of the Registrar, drew by lot the names of the nine additional judges needed to complete the Grand Chamber, namely Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr N. Valticos, Mr A.B. Baka, Mr L. Wildhaber, Mr D. Gotchev, Mr U. Lōhmus, Mr E. Levits and Mr P. van Dijk (Rule 51 § 2 (c)).

Having taken note of the agreement of the Agent of the Government and the concurring opinions of the Delegate of the Commission and of the applicant, the Court decided on 25 October 1997 that it was not necessary to hold a further hearing following the relinquishment of jurisdiction by the Chamber (Rule 38, taken together with Rule 51 § 6).

Subsequently, Mr Bernhardt replaced Mr Ryssdal, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case, as President of the Grand Chamber (Rule 21 § 5).

AS TO THE FACTS

I. THE circumstances of the case

Mrs Phyllis Bowman was born in 1926 and lives in London. She is the executive director of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child (“SPUC”), an organisation of approximately 50,000 members which is opposed to abortion and human embryo experimentation and seeks changes to the present United Kingdom law which permits abortion up to twenty-two weeks and embryo experimentation up to fourteen days.

The major political parties have no policies with regard to abortion and embryo experimentation: these are regarded as moral issues and members of Parliament are allowed to vote on proposed legislation according to their consciences. Mrs Bowman and SPUC therefore took the view that, if electors were to be in a position to bring about changes to the law through their choice of representative, it was important for them to be informed of the opinions of candidates standing for election with regard to abortion and related issues.

In the period immediately before the parliamentary elections in April 1992, Mrs Bowman therefore arranged to have some one and a half million leaflets distributed in constituencies throughout the United Kingdom, including, in the constituency of Halifax, 25,000 copies of a leaflet which read as follows: “We are not telling you how to vote, but it is essential for you to check on Candidates’ voting intentions on abortion and on the use of the human embryo as a guinea-pig. Terry Martin, Conservative. Mr Martin has publicly declared his firm commitment to defending the unborn child. If elected, he would vote to tighten the grounds for abortion to stop abortion on demand. He would vote to stop abortion after 24 weeks, as the law currently allows abortion up to birth for handicapped babies and on other grounds. Would vote to stop the creation and use of human embryos as guinea-pigs for drug testing. Alison Mahon, Labour. Mrs Mahon is a leading pro-abortionist. As an MP she voted to allow abortion up to birth for handicapped babies. She voted for the compulsory enrolment on a published register of doctors with a conscientious objection to abortion despite warnings that it could be used as a blacklist. She also voted to allow human embryos to be used as guinea-pigs in programmes including the testing of drugs and other experiments. Ian Howell, Liberal Democrat. If elected, Mr Howell would vote for the tightening of the grounds for abortion to stop abortion on demand. He would vote to reduce the time-limit to 24 weeks or less, where the law currently allows abortion up to birth for handicapped babies and on other grounds. He would vote to protect human embryos from being used as guinea‑pigs in research programmes. THE SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE UNBORN CHILD” On the reverse side of the leaflet, together with a picture marked “an unborn baby ten weeks after conception”, was printed: “The First Weeks of Life Day 1: Conception – sperm and ovum meet in fertilisation. Genetic make-up complete. Colour of eyes, hair, sex and even build determined. A unique individual is present in the womb’s fallopian tube. Day 12: Has travelled to the womb and implanted there. Day 17: Development of own blood cells. Day 21: Heart starts to beat. This is at least as dramatic as birth, but far less dramatic than fertilisation. Day 26: Foundation of central nervous system established. Day 30: Regular blood flow within closed vascular system. Ears and nose start to develop. Day 42: Skeleton and reflexes present. Liver, kidneys and lungs formed. Responds to touch around the mouth. Day 45: Electrical brainwave patterns can be recorded. Day 56: All organs functioning except the lungs; the baby only has to grow and mature now, just as a child grows into an adult. Day 65: The baby can make a fist and will grasp an object stroking his palm; leaps up and down in the womb with movements co-ordinated. Week 12: Entire surface of the body sensitive to touch. Week 16: Baby is half birth length; the heart pumps 50 pints of blood daily. Week 28: Eyes open. Baby can hear mother’s digestive processes, heartbeat and her voice, as well as sounds outside her body. 9th Month: Birth – just another stage in an already well-advanced process. From the above it is clear that the baby can feel pain at a very early stage. We are, therefore, destroying babies painfully up to 6 months after conception, and in some cases, such as handicap, up to birth.”

Mrs Bowman was charged with an offence under subsections 75(1) and (5) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (“the 1983 Act”), which prohibits expenditure of more than five pounds sterling (“GBP”) by an unauthorised person during the period before an election on conveying information to electors with a view to promoting or procuring the election of a candidate (see paragraphs 17–19 below).

At Mrs Bowman’s trial at Southwark Crown Court on 27 September 1993, the judge directed her acquittal, because the summons charging her with the offence had not been issued within one year of the alleged prohibited expenditure, in accordance with the time-limit stipulated in section 176 of the 1983 Act. The proceedings were, nonetheless, reported in the press.

In 1979, Mrs Bowman had been convicted of an offence under similar legislation in respect of a leaflet distributed prior to the Ilford North by-election and in 1982 she had also been convicted in respect of a leaflet distributed during the elections for the European Parliament. On both occasions she was ordered to pay a fine and the prosecution costs.","{'applicant': 'Phyllis Bowman', 'articles': [91, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 50, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 48, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'GRANDCHAMBER', 'year': 1998}",001-58134

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) and by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (“the Government”) on 19 October 1996 and on 7 January 1997 respectively, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 24839/94) against the United Kingdom lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by Mrs Phyllis Bowman, a British citizen, on 11 March 1994. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 of the Convention and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46). The object of the request and of the Government’s application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 10 of the Convention.

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that she wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent her (Rule 30).

The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 § 4 (b)). On 29 October 1996, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr B. Walsh, Mr C. Russo, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr A.N. Loizou, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha and Mr P. Jambrek (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 5).

As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s representative and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 § 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence and an extension of the time-limit granted at the request of the applicant, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial on 3 June 1997 and the applicant’s memorial on 18 July 1997.

In accordance with the decision of the President, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 27 August 1997. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr D. Bentley, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr D. Pannick QC, Mr D. Anderson, Counsel, Mr R. Clayton, Home Office, Adviser; (b) for the Commission Mr L. Loucaides, Delegate; (c) for the applicant Mr G. Robertson QC, Counsel, Mr D. Price, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr Loucaides, Mr Pannick and Mr Robertson.

Following deliberations held on 29 August 1997 the Chamber decided to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of a Grand Chamber (Rule 51).

The Grand Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr Ryssdal, the President of the Court, and Mr Bernhardt, the Vice-President, together with the other members and substitute judges of the original Chamber, the latter being Mrs E.

The case originated in an application (no. 62179/00) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mrs Irena Pieniążek (“the applicant”), on 1 August 1999.

The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mr K. Drzewicki and subsequently Mr. J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

On 21 January 2003 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Gdynia, Poland. She is a historian by profession and used to work as a curator in the Gdynia City Museum.

On 10 September 1996 the applicant brought a private prosecution on charges of libel against S.L. the director of the Gdynia City Museum to the Gdynia District Court (Sąd Rejonowy).

On 24 April 1997 the court held a conciliatory hearing. The applicant requested that S.L. retract in the press her defamatory statements. The defendant refused.

The trial began on 27 May 1997 but the applicant failed to appear. The court discontinued the proceedings on the ground that the applicant had been duly summoned. The court considered that the applicant had been notified about the service of the summons but failed to collect it from the post office. On 19 June 1997 the applicant appealed against this decision. On 2 September 1997 the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) quashed that decision and ordered that the District Court proceed with the case.

On 20 July 1998 the applicant filed a complaint with the District Court submitting that the length of the proceedings in her case had exceeded any reasonable time limit. On 31 July 1998 the president of the Criminal Division of the District Court informed her that the delay in the proceedings was caused by the presiding judge's illness.

On 25 October 1999 the president of the Criminal Division of the District Court ordered that the case be transferred to another judge.

The next hearing was held on 17 March 2000. On that date upon the court's order, the applicant specified the charges against S.L. Consequently, the court adjourned the hearing to consider discontinuation of the proceedings.

On 28 March 2000 the Gdynia District Court discontinued the proceedings, as the offence was time-barred. The court held that the applicant submitted her private prosecution after the time-limit of 3 months from the date on which she had become aware of the identity of the defendant.","{'applicant': 'Irena Pieniążek', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'POL', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2004}",001-66723
144,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 24647/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Yücel Doğan (“the applicant”), on 8 June 2004.

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

On 11 March 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in İzmir.

On 7 June 1997 the applicant passed an exam for the post of a private security guard and was subsequently employed to work for Etibank, a State-owned company. However, the exam results were subsequently annulled on the basis of a report prepared by inspectors who had found a number of wrongdoings in the conduct of the examination. The applicant's contract of employment was terminated.

On 27 November 1997 the applicant brought an action before the 7th Chamber of the Ankara Administrative Court, challenging the annulment of the exam results. He also asked to be reassigned to his post. The Ankara Administrative Court decided on 9 December 1997 that it had no jurisdiction to examine the case and forwarded the case file to the Konya Administrative Court.

On 5 March 1998 the Konya court decided that it also did not have jurisdiction to examine the case and sent the file to the Supreme Administrative Court which decided, on 15 June 1998, that the Ankara Administrative Court had jurisdiction.

On 14 April 1999 the 7th Chamber of the Ankara Administrative Court decided in favour of the applicant and he was reinstated in his previous post. The court found that the annulment of the exam should not have affected the successful candidates who, by having met the necessary criteria, had passed the exam properly. The bank appealed against the decision on 28 June 1999.

On 15 November 2001 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the decision. The court found that the report drawn up by the inspectors contained sufficient reasons for the annulment of the exam. The Supreme Administrative Court attached weight to the gravity of the wrongdoings pointed out in that report and concluded that the employment of personnel through such an exam would not be fair. On 26 June 2002 the applicant was dismissed from his job once more.

On 18 September 2002 the 7th Chamber of the Ankara Administrative Court followed the Supreme Administrative Court's decision and rejected the applicant's request. On 3 December 2002 the applicant appealed.

On 29 December 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the decision of 18 September 2002. The final decision was communicated to the applicant on 10 May 2004.","{'applicant': 'Yücel Doğan', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2009}",001-94737
145,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 50015/99) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Mr James Roberts Hewitson (“the applicant”), on 16 March 1999.

The applicant was represented by Mr K. O’Neill, a lawyer practising in Bournemouth. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant complained of the installation and use by the police of a covert listening device at his place of work. The case as declared admissible raises complaints under Article 8 of the Convention.

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1. On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1) This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).

By a decision of 22 October 2002, the Court declared the application partly admissible, partly inadmissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1948 and is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment in HMP Verne.

The applicant owned a garage in Dorset and had business connections in Spain. He had two Mercedes cars each of which had a false compartment in the fuel tank. The false compartments could hold up to 45 kilograms of cannabis resin. From 1994 he was suspected by the police of being involved in drug trafficking. The police also suspected him of being involved in the handling of stolen goods, including stolen vehicles.

On 22 February 1995 he was arrested by the Dorset police in relation to their suspicions of his handling stolen goods. Whilst he was in custody, a listening device was installed at his garage premises which remained there and active until 26 July 1995 when it was discovered.

On 30 December 1996 an indictment was signed charging the applicant with conspiracy to import controlled drugs and conspiracy to supply controlled drugs, namely cannabis. The prosecution evidence against the applicant relied on tape recordings made from the listening device which had been installed by the police at the applicant’s garage premises. It was acknowledged by the prosecution that without the evidence from the tapes, there was no prima facie case against the applicant.

The applicant objected to the admission of the tape recordings as evidence in his trial. He argued inter alia that the original grant of authority and the renewal of authority for the placement of the listening device were not in compliance with the Home Office Guidelines, which governed the use of surveillance equipment by the police at the relevant time. He submitted that his prosecution ought to be stayed as an abuse of the process of the court, alternatively the tape evidence should be excluded under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (“PACE”).

A preliminary hearing was held on the matter of the admissibility of the tape recordings. His Honour Judge Pryor QC held on 8 July 1997 that he was satisfied that the original authority for the use of the surveillance equipment was properly granted and that there were proper grounds for renewal, though he made some criticism of the lack of documentation on the renewals and noted that there had been a technical infringement in that one renewal took place a day late. The judge concluded that the tapes were admissible as evidence and should not be excluded under section 78 of PACE.

Following the admission of the tapes as evidence, the applicant pleaded guilty to the charges of conspiracy to import controlled drugs and conspiracy to supply controlled drugs, namely cannabis. On 5 September 1997 he was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.

The applicant was granted leave to appeal against his conviction. On 24 September 1997, the Court of Appeal held that in the light of the applicant’s pleas of guilty his convictions could not be regarded as “unsafe” and rejected his appeal.","{'applicant': 'James Roberts Hewitson', 'articles': [91, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2003}",001-61100

The applicant was represented by Mr K. O’Neill, a lawyer practising in Bournemouth. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant complained of the installation and use by the police of a covert listening device at his place of work. The case as declared admissible raises complaints under Article 8 of the Convention.

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1. On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1) This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).

By a decision of 22 October 2002, the Court declared the application partly admissible, partly inadmissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1948 and is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment in HMP Verne.

The applicant owned a garage in Dorset and had business connections in Spain. He had two Mercedes cars each of which had a false compartment in the fuel tank. The false compartments could hold up to 45 kilograms of cannabis resin. From 1994 he was suspected by the police of being involved in drug trafficking. The police also suspected him of being involved in the handling of stolen goods, including stolen vehicles.

On 22 February 1995 he was arrested by the Dorset police in relation to their suspicions of his handling stolen goods. Whilst he was in custody, a listening device was installed at his garage premises which remained there and active until 26 July 1995 when it was discovered.

On 30 December 1996 an indictment was signed charging the applicant with conspiracy to import controlled drugs and conspiracy to supply controlled drugs, namely cannabis. The prosecution evidence against the applicant relied on tape recordings made from the listening device which had been installed by the police at the applicant’s garage premises. It was acknowledged by the prosecution that without the evidence from the tapes, there was no prima facie case against the applicant.

The applicant objected to the admission of the tape recordings as evidence in his trial. He argued inter alia that the original grant of authority and the renewal of authority for the placement of the listening device were not in compliance with the Home Office Guidelines, which governed the use of surveillance equipment by the police at the relevant time. He submitted that his prosecution ought to be stayed as an abuse of the process of the court, alternatively the tape evidence should be excluded under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (“PACE”).

A preliminary hearing was held on the matter of the admissibility of the tape recordings. His Honour Judge Pryor QC held on 8 July 1997 that he was satisfied that the original authority for the use of the surveillance equipment was properly granted and that there were proper grounds for renewal, though he made some criticism of the lack of documentation on the renewals and noted that there had been a technical infringement in that one renewal took place a day late. The judge concluded that the tapes were admissible as evidence and should not be excluded under section 78 of PACE.

Following the admission of the tapes as evidence, the applicant pleaded guilty to the charges of conspiracy to import controlled drugs and conspiracy to supply controlled drugs, namely cannabis. On 5 September 1997 he was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.

The applicant was granted leave to appeal against his conviction. On 24 September 1997, the Court of Appeal held that in the light of the applicant’s pleas of guilty his convictions could not be regarded as “unsafe” and rejected his appeal.","{'applicant': 'James Roberts Hewitson', 'articles': [91, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2003}",001-61100

The applicant was represented by Mr E. Doğan, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court

The applicant complained, in particular, about the excessive length of the civil proceedings, the non-enforcement of the court decision, as well as the authorities’ subsequent delay in paying the additional compensation awarded by the domestic courts.

On 14 February 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Istanbul.

On 25 June 1987 the Istanbul Municipality decided to expropriate two houses that belonged to the applicant and located in Beyoğlu, Istanbul. The applicant filed an action before the Istanbul Administrative Court to annul the decision of the Municipality. On 22 December 1993 the Administrative Court dismissed his request. A committee of experts assessed the value of the property at 11.590.000 Turkish Liras (TRL), and this amount was consequently paid to the applicant when the expropriation took place.

On 18 January 1994 the applicant filed an action before the Beyoğlu Civil Court of General Jurisdiction for increased compensation.

On 28 May 1998 there was a hearing attended by neither the applicant nor his lawyer. Subsequently, the court decided to close the case until the applicant renewed his petition. On 5 June 1998, following the new petition filed by the applicant’s lawyer, the case was resumed.

Twenty three hearings were held before the Beyoğlu Civil Court of General Jurisdiction, during six of which neither the applicant nor his lawyer were present.

On 16 July 1998 the court awarded the applicant TRL 615.478.0000 of additional compensation, plus interest at the statutory rate, as of 22 December 1993.

Following the applicant’s appeal, on 19 December 2000 the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the Beyoğlu court. This decision was notified to the applicant on 26 January 2001.

The applicant requested the Court of Cassation to rectify its decision. On 23 March 2001 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s request.

In his observations dated 30 June 2006, the applicant informed the Registry that he had not yet been paid the award determined by the first-instance court on 16 July 1998.","{'applicant': 'Mustafa Nazif Dildar', 'articles': [91, 34, 51, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 50, 57, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2006}",001-78431

The case originated in an application (no. 17582/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Eyüp Kaya (“the applicant”), on 26 April 2004.

The applicant was represented by Mr M. Timur, a lawyer practising in Van. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

On 18 September 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Van.

On 29 August 2000 the applicant was admitted to the military service.

On 7 September 2001 he went to see a doctor at the Sivas Military Hospital for an eye-sight problem. His medical report stated that he had ‑ 6, 25 of myopia (nearsightedness), +0,25 of hyperopia (farsightedness) and – 6,75 of anisometropia amblyopia (difference in refractive error between the two eyes leading to reduced vision in one eye) on his left eye. The report noted that the applicant had complained that he had had the problem on his left eye since childhood. Accordingly, the applicant was discharged from the military as he was no longer eligible for service.

On 17 March 2003, the applicant applied to both, the Retired Civil Servant’s Fund for a pension and to the Compensation Commission at the Ministry of the Interior for compensation. Both requests were rejected.

On 21 May 2003 the applicant obtained a certificate from the office of the headman (muhtarlık) attesting his indigence.

On 5 June 2003, the applicant brought an action against the Ministry of the Interior before the Supreme Military Administrative Court requesting compensation of 30,000,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL)0. In his petition the applicant alleged, inter alia, that he had no such eye problems prior to his service in the army. He further referred to the doctrine of “social risk”, which did not require the establishment of any causal link between the harmful action and the loss. The applicant also requested legal aid to cover the payment of the court fees.

On 24 July 2003 the Supreme Military Administrative Court, after examining the case file and hearing the observations of the rapporteur, dismissed the applicant’s request for legal aid on the ground that the case was not well‑founded.

On 25 July 2003, the Supreme Military Administrative Court notified the applicant that he was required to pay a court fee which was TRL 476,970,000 (approximately 292 euros).

In the meantime, on 19 August 2008, the applicant was examined by doctors at Van State Hospital. The latter confirmed that the applicant had strong myopic degeneration (-8 degrees) in his left eye amounting to 37 % of loss of sight.

On 12 November 2003, the court discontinued the proceedings on the ground that the applicant failed to pay the necessary court fees.

On 20 December 2003 the applicant was notified of this decision.","{'applicant': 'Eyüp Kaya', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-88502
155,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 31834/96) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Hasan Yağız (“the applicant”), on 4 June 1996.

The applicant did not appoint a lawyer for his representation. The Turkish Government did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of the criminal proceedings against him.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr Rıza Türmen, the judge elected in respect of Tukey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr Feyyaz Gölcüklü to sit as an ad hoc judge, in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).

The President of the Chamber decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the present application should be joined to other applications against the same respondent State raising the same complaints (applications nos. 26480/95, 28291/95, 29280/95, 26699/96, 29700/96, 29701/96, 29702/96, 29703/96, 29911/96, 29912/96, 29913/96, 31831/96, 31853/96, 31880/96, 31891/96, 31960/96, 32987/96, 32900/96, 32964/96, 33362/96, 33369/96, 33645/96, 34591/96, 34687/96, 39428/96 and 43362/96) (Rule 43 § 2).

By a decision of 31 August 1999, having obtained the parties’ observations, the Court declared the application admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

A. Arrest and detention of the applicant

On 17 April 1985 police officers from the Ankara Security Directorate arrested the applicant on suspicion of membership of an illegal armed organisation, the Dev-Yol (Revolutionary Way).

On 6 February 1985 the Ankara Martial Law Court (sıkıyönetim mahkemesi) ordered the applicant’s detention on remand.

B. Trial in the Ankara Martial Law Court

On an unspecified date in 1985 the Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Martial Law Court against the applicant. The Public Prosecutor accused the applicant, inter alia, of membership of the Dev-Yol, whose object was to undermine the constitutional order and replace it with a Marxist-Leninist regime. The prosecution sought the death penalty under Article 146 § 1 of the Turkish Criminal Code. It was further decided that this indictment should be joined to the indictment of 26 February 1982 lodged against 722 other Dev-Yol defendants.

On 11 May 1988 the Ankara Martial Law Court ordered the applicant’s release pending trial.

In a judgment of 19 July 1989 the Martial Law Court convicted the applicant on account of his involvement in the Dev-Yol. It sentenced the applicant to six years’ imprisonment under Article 146 § 3 of the Turkish Criminal Code.

C. Proceedings on appeal

The applicant appealed to the Military Court of Cassation (askeri yargıtay).

Following promulgation of the Law of 27 December 1993, which abolished the jurisdiction of the Martial Law Courts, the Court of Cassation (yargıtay) acquired jurisdiction over the case and on 26 December 1994 the case file was transmitted to it.

On 27 December 1995 the Court of Cassation upheld the above judgment.","{'applicant': 'Hasan Yağız', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 51, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2001}",001-59864

The applicant was represented by Mr J. Mackenzie, a lawyer practising in Oxfordshire. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant mainly complained under Article 5 §§ 3 and 5 of the Convention about his pre-trial detention and under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 of the Convention about his summary trial before his Commanding Officer.

On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1) and the present case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Durham. At the relevant time he was a Lance Corporal in the British army stationed in Northern Ireland.

In August 1996 he was reported to his Commanding Officer on a wounding charge, which incident had allegedly occurred in May 1996. On 21 November 1996 he was arrested on two unrelated charges of failing to attend and disobeying a lawful command. On 22 November 1996 he appeared, on the orders of his Commanding Officer, on the latter two charges and he was reduced to the ranks. On the same day he was also remanded for an abstract of evidence (see paragraph 21 below) to be compiled on a charge of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.

In early December 1996 he went missing from his unit. On 27 January 1997 he was arrested in England by the civilian police, charged with aggravated burglary and handed over to the military authorities. When it was discovered that he had been absent without leave, he was placed in close arrest in the guardroom of Catterick garrison. On 28 January 1997 he was escorted under close arrest back to Northern Ireland.

The Government maintained that a copy of the information pamphlet entitled “The rights of a soldier charged with an offence under the Army Act 1955” (1994 edition) would have been available to the applicant at Catterick garrison and would have been provided to him against signature of a form acknowledging receipt. Since the relevant disciplinary file was lost, the Government could not provide a copy of the form. The applicant accepted that he received a copy of the pamphlet while in close arrest in Northern Ireland and that it was likely to have been the 1994 version of the pamphlet.

On 30 January 1997 he appeared before his Commanding Officer who remanded him in close arrest and ordered an abstract of evidence to be compiled on the absence without leave charge with a view to that Officer applying for power to award extended detention (paragraphs 21 and 24 below). No such application was in fact made. During that hearing the applicant received a copy of the charge sheet (the absence without leave charge). The applicant maintained, and the Government denied, that at that same meeting he was asked by his Commanding Officer whether he would be pleading guilty or not guilty and that he had indicated the former.

On 13 February 1997 the applicant appeared before his Commanding Officer when the latter read the charge of absence without leave and formally asked the applicant whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty. He pleaded guilty and he was awarded 28 days’ military detention. On that day he was also remanded for trial on the wounding charge. The applicant claimed that he was not afforded the opportunity of electing trial by court-martial whereas the Government submitted that he would have been given this option by the Commanding Officer before the finding of guilty was recorded on 13 February 1997.

On 26 February 1997 the applicant appeared before a Magistrates’ Court in Newcastle (England) on the aggravated burglary charge and was remanded on bail until 28 March 1997. He completed his military sentence of imprisonment on 7 March 1997. He was then informed by his Commanding Officer that he was to be retained in close arrest until his trial by court-martial on the wounding charge. He was then released to open arrest on 12 March 1997 following representations by his civilian solicitor. In March 1997 the civilian prosecuting authorities discontinued the burglary proceedings. In June 1997 a notice of temporary discontinuance issued as regards the court-martial proceedings on the wounding charge. No further action on that charge has been taken against the applicant who was subsequently administratively discharged in August 1997 for reasons not related to the afore-mentioned charges or conviction.","{'applicant': 'Albert Thompson', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2004}",001-61816

On 26 February 1997 the applicant appeared before a Magistrates’ Court in Newcastle (England) on the aggravated burglary charge and was remanded on bail until 28 March 1997. He completed his military sentence of imprisonment on 7 March 1997. He was then informed by his Commanding Officer that he was to be retained in close arrest until his trial by court-martial on the wounding charge. He was then released to open arrest on 12 March 1997 following representations by his civilian solicitor. In March 1997 the civilian prosecuting authorities discontinued the burglary proceedings. In June 1997 a notice of temporary discontinuance issued as regards the court-martial proceedings on the wounding charge.

The case originated in an application (no. 36256/97) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an United Kingdom national, Mr Albert Thompson (“the applicant”), on 16 May 1997.

The applicant was represented by Mr J. Mackenzie, a lawyer practising in Oxfordshire. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant mainly complained under Article 5 §§ 3 and 5 of the Convention about his pre-trial detention and under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 of the Convention about his summary trial before his Commanding Officer.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

It was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

On 20 March 2001 the application was declared partly admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1) and the present case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Durham. At the relevant time he was a Lance Corporal in the British army stationed in Northern Ireland.

In August 1996 he was reported to his Commanding Officer on a wounding charge, which incident had allegedly occurred in May 1996. On 21 November 1996 he was arrested on two unrelated charges of failing to attend and disobeying a lawful command. On 22 November 1996 he appeared, on the orders of his Commanding Officer, on the latter two charges and he was reduced to the ranks. On the same day he was also remanded for an abstract of evidence (see paragraph 21 below) to be compiled on a charge of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.

In early December 1996 he went missing from his unit. On 27 January 1997 he was arrested in England by the civilian police, charged with aggravated burglary and handed over to the military authorities. When it was discovered that he had been absent without leave, he was placed in close arrest in the guardroom of Catterick garrison. On 28 January 1997 he was escorted under close arrest back to Northern Ireland.

The Government maintained that a copy of the information pamphlet entitled “The rights of a soldier charged with an offence under the Army Act 1955” (1994 edition) would have been available to the applicant at Catterick garrison and would have been provided to him against signature of a form acknowledging receipt. Since the relevant disciplinary file was lost, the Government could not provide a copy of the form. The applicant accepted that he received a copy of the pamphlet while in close arrest in Northern Ireland and that it was likely to have been the 1994 version of the pamphlet.

On 30 January 1997 he appeared before his Commanding Officer who remanded him in close arrest and ordered an abstract of evidence to be compiled on the absence without leave charge with a view to that Officer applying for power to award extended detention (paragraphs 21 and 24 below). No such application was in fact made. During that hearing the applicant received a copy of the charge sheet (the absence without leave charge). The applicant maintained, and the Government denied, that at that same meeting he was asked by his Commanding Officer whether he would be pleading guilty or not guilty and that he had indicated the former.

On 13 February 1997 the applicant appeared before his Commanding Officer when the latter read the charge of absence without leave and formally asked the applicant whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty. He pleaded guilty and he was awarded 28 days’ military detention. On that day he was also remanded for trial on the wounding charge. The applicant claimed that he was not afforded the opportunity of electing trial by court-martial whereas the Government submitted that he would have been given this option by the Commanding Officer before the finding of guilty was recorded on 13 February 1997.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1974. He is currently serving a prison sentence.

On 9 November 2004 the Opole Regional Court convicted the applicant of manslaughter and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment. The prosecution appealed.

On 8 December 2004 J.G., the lawyer assigned to represent the applicant under the legal‑aid scheme, also submitted an appeal against the first-instance judgment, arguing that the sentence was too severe. In the same pleadings J.G. also requested the court to dispense him from his obligation to represent the applicant and to appoint another lawyer to the case.

In a letter of the same date he informed the applicant that, in his view, the appeal offered no reasonable prospects of success. He also stated that under no circumstances would he represent him for the purposes of cassation proceedings.

On 16 December 2004 the Wroclaw Court of Appeal dismissed both appeals. In the proceedings before the appellate court the applicant was represented by another legal‑aid lawyer, D.K.

On 4 March 2005 the court allowed the applicant’s request for the grant of legal aid and assigned J.G. to represent him for the purposes of cassation proceedings.

On 15 March 2005 the second-instance judgment with the written statement of reasons was served on both the applicant and his lawyer.

By a letter of 16 March 2005 the lawyer requested the court to be exempted from the obligation to represent the applicant. He submitted that he had already informed the applicant that he would prepare an appeal against the first‑instance judgment on the ground that in the circumstances of the case the sentence was disproportionate. He had also informed him that, in his view, this appeal offered no reasonable prospects of success. In the light of the judgment of the Court of Appeal his opinion proved justified. He also stated that he had warned the applicant that under no circumstances would he represent him for the purposes of cassation proceedings. In his view, there were no grounds on which to accept that any grounds for a cassation appeal obtained in the case. This was so because in the appeal against the first-instance judgment he had relied only on the disproportionate nature of the sentence, which could not be argued before the Supreme Court.

The Wrocław Court of Appeal informed the applicant of this refusal by a letter dated 22 March 2005. It was further stated that in these circumstances the only course of action left to the applicant was to request the Ombudsman to lodge a cassation appeal on his behalf.

The case originated in an application (no. 71841/01) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged on 14 May 1998 with the European Commission of Human Rights under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Cahit Yetkinsekerci (“the applicant”).

The British Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Willmott, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

On 11 December 2003 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.

THE FACTS

The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Gaziantep.

On 3 September 1997, 79 packages of powder (subsequently found to be starch) were found in the belly tank of the apparently unladen lorry which the applicant had just brought into the United Kingdom. The applicant was arrested, and on 4 September 1997 he was charged with knowingly being involved in the attempted import of a controlled drug (diamorphine). He was convicted on 25 March 1998 and sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment. His application for leave to appeal arrived at the Criminal Appeals Office on 23 April 1998, and leave to appeal and legal aid were granted on 22 March 1999.

The Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal on 6 March 2001. As to sentence it found as follows: “76. ... The points ... are, first, that no diamorphine was imported and that seems to us to be the most important point, namely that this was an offence of attempt and not of actual importation.

Second, that the appellant appears to have occupied a lowly position in what was undoubtedly an extensive chain, stretching from source abroad into this country.

Third, it is said that there was no evidence that he knew of the quantity involved. However, in that respect, in a massive importation of this kind, it is not usual to investigate how far an appellant was privy to the actual amount involved, bearing in mind that it would obviously have been an extremely substantial importation.

Fourth, the point is made that he is isolated from his country of origin, serving a sentence in England.

Fifth, that his age is 49, he is of previous good character and family responsibilities also militate for mercy.

We attach some slight importance to the fourth element. So far as the fifth is concerned it is not one in which of a case of this kind we regard appropriate and to take into consideration [sic].

Finally, counsel has advanced upon us the argument that this appeal has taken, as it undoubtedly has taken, an unconscionably long time to come on, for reasons which are no fault of the appellant or his advisers, but appear to have related to administrative difficulties within this court. He makes reference in that respect to Article 6 of the Convention on Human Rights. However, it is not necessary to invoke that Article for the court to take into account, if it considers it appropriate, a delay of that kind.

We consider that, absent any reason for reduction of an unusual kind, had this importation been an importation of diamorphine, as the appellant no doubt believed it to be, a sentence of 18 years could have been expected. It does appear that, on the basis that it was simply an attempt, the judge reduced the level of sentence to the order of 14 years, bearing in mind the appellant’s apparent position in the chain.

In our view, a somewhat greater allowance could well have been made, allowing this with the fact that the defendant has spent a time of some anxiety, no doubt, waiting for longer than he should, in order to see whether his sentence would be reduced, we consider that it is appropriate to reduce the sentence of 14 years imposed to one of 12 years’ imprisonment. The appeal upon the sentence will be successful to that extent.”

The applicant was released after having served approximately one half of the 12 year sentence, and deported to Turkey.","{'applicant': 'Cahit Yetkinsekerci', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 51, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 51, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2005}",001-70729

His application for leave to appeal arrived at the Criminal Appeals Office on 23 April 1998, and leave to appeal and legal aid were granted on 22 March 1999.

The Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal on 6 March 2001. As to sentence it found as follows: “76. ... The points ... are, first, that no diamorphine was imported and that seems to us to be the most important point, namely that this was an offence of attempt and not of actual importation.

Second, that the appellant appears to have occupied a lowly position in what was undoubtedly an extensive chain, stretching from source abroad into this country.

Third, it is said that there was no evidence that he knew of the quantity involved. However, in that respect, in a massive importation of this kind, it is not usual to investigate how far an appellant was privy to the actual amount involved, bearing in mind that it would obviously have been an extremely substantial importation.

Fourth, the point is made that he is isolated from his country of origin, serving a sentence in England.

Fifth, that his age is 49, he is of previous good character and family responsibilities also militate for mercy.

We attach some slight importance to the fourth element. So far as the fifth is concerned it is not one in which of a case of this kind we regard appropriate and to take into consideration [sic].

Finally, counsel has advanced upon us the argument that this appeal has taken, as it undoubtedly has taken, an unconscionably long time to come on, for reasons which are no fault of the appellant or his advisers, but appear to have related to administrative difficulties within this court. He makes reference in that respect to Article 6 of the Convention on Human Rights. However, it is not necessary to invoke that Article for the court to take into account, if it considers it appropriate, a delay of that kind.

We consider that, absent any reason for reduction of an unusual kind, had this importation been an importation of diamorphine, as the appellant no doubt believed it to be, a sentence of 18 years could have been expected. It does appear that, on the basis that it was simply an attempt, the judge reduced the level of sentence to the order of 14 years, bearing in mind the appellant’s apparent position in the chain.

In our view, a somewhat greater allowance could well have been made, allowing this with the fact that the defendant has spent a time of some anxiety, no doubt, waiting for longer than he should, in order to see whether his sentence would be reduced, we consider that it is appropriate to reduce the sentence of 14 years imposed to one of 12 years’ imprisonment. The appeal upon the sentence will be successful to that extent.”

The case originated in an application (no. 71841/01) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged on 14 May 1998 with the European Commission of Human Rights under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Cahit Yetkinsekerci (“the applicant”).

The British Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Willmott, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

On 11 December 2003 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.

THE FACTS

The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Gaziantep.

On 3 September 1997, 79 packages of powder (subsequently found to be starch) were found in the belly tank of the apparently unladen lorry which the applicant had just brought into the United Kingdom.

The case was referred to the Court, as established under former Article 19 of the Convention, by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (“the Government”) on 14 August 1998, within the three-month period laid down by former Articles 32 § 1 and 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 27267/95) against the United Kingdom lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 by a British national, Mr David Hood, on 18 April 1995. The Government’s application referred to former Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (former Article 46). Although the Government reserved its position as to whether they would contest the Commission’s opinion as to a violation of Article 5 §§ 3 and 5, the express object of the reference was to obtain a decision as to the amount of just satisfaction, if any, which should be awarded to the applicant under Article 41 of the Convention.

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of former Rules of Court A1, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (former Rule 30).

As President of the Chamber which had originally been constituted (former Article 43 of the Convention and former Rule 21) in order to deal, in particular, with procedural matters that might arise before the entry into force of Protocol No. 11, Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, the Vice-President of the Court at the time, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government and the applicant’s lawyer on the organisation of the written procedure. Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received both the Government’s and the applicant’s memorials on 17 November 1998.

After the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 § 5 thereof, the case was referred to the Grand Chamber of the Court. The Grand Chamber included ex officio Sir Nicolas Bratza, the judge elected in respect of the United Kingdom (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 24 § 4 of the Rules of Court), MrL.Wildhaber, the President of the Court, Mrs E. Palm, Vice-President of the Court, and Mr J.-P. Costa and Mr M.Fischbach, Vice-Presidents of Sections (Article 27 § 3 of the Convention and Rule 24 §§ 3 and 5 (a)). The other members appointed to complete the Grand Chamber were Mr L. Ferrari Bravo, Mr P. Kūris, Mr W. Fuhrmann, Mr K. Jungwiert, Mr B. Zupančič, Mrs N. Vajić, Mr J. Hedigan, Mrs W. Thomassen, Mrs M. Tsatsa-Nikolovska, Mr T. Panţîru, Mr E. Levits and Mr K. Traja (Rule 24 § 3 and Rule 100 § 4). Subsequently Sir Nicolas Bratza, who had taken part in the Commission’s examination of the case, withdrew from sitting in the Grand Chamber (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Sir John Freeland to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).

The President decided that it was not necessary to invite the Commission to delegate one of its members to take part in the proceedings before the Grand Chamber (Rule 99).

In accordance with the President’s decision, a hearing in this case and in the case of Cable and Others v. the United Kingdom took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 9 December 1998. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr C. Whomersley, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr P. Havers QC, Counsel; (b) for the applicant Mr J. Mackenzie, Solicitor, Counsel, Ms K. Duigan, Adviser. The Court heard addresses by Mr Mackenzie and Mr Havers.

THE FACTS

I. The CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, David Hood, is a British national born in 1970. He resides in the United Kingdom. At the relevant time, he was a soldier with the regular forces of the British army.

Prior to the events in question, the applicant went absent without leave from his unit in Germany three times. Prior to his third absence, he had been remanded for trial by court martial on an assault charge (later abandoned), he remained absent for almost two and a half years and he gave himself up to the civilian police in December 1993.

A. The relevant detention and court martial of the applicant

On 11 May 1994 the applicant did not return after two weeks’ leave (his fourth absence without leave). On 27 November 1994 he was arrested at his home by the civilian police and on 28 November 1994 he was taken by army escort to Brompton Barracks. Before the Court, the parties disputed whether the applicant was then brought before his commanding officer on 29 November 1994 pursuant to Rule 4 of the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 (see paragraph 29 below).

The applicant remained in close arrest until his court martial. He was detained in a cell in a guardroom under the supervision of a guard apart from certain occasions when he was taken to hospital for psychiatric care.

In or about December 1994 the applicant was informed that he would have to appear before the unit adjutant after Christmas. He retained a solicitor prior to Christmas, who advised him until 17 January 1995. On 4 January 1995 the applicant appeared before the unit adjutant and was given the abstract of evidence. He was told that he should read the abstract and check that it was accurate. The applicant was cautioned pursuant to Rule 10 of the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 (see paragraph 32 below).

Acting on his original solicitor’s advice, the applicant prepared his own statement and obtained a statement from his girlfriend, which statements were completed on 4 and 19 January 1995 respectively. The applicant submitted both statements to the adjutant on 20 January 1995, which statements were then attached to the abstract of evidence. The applicant was then remanded for trial by court martial by his commanding officer and he applied for legal aid from the military authorities. The charge sheet, dated 25 January 1995 and signed by his commanding officer and on behalf of the convening officer, recorded two charges of absence without leave and two of desertion contrary to the Army Act 1955.

Although the applicant instructed his present solicitor in early February, the latter did not commence work for the applicant until legal aid was granted by the Ministry of Defence by letter dated 14 February 1995.

By notice dated 17 March 1995 a district court martial was convened to try the applicant on the charges. The court martial took place on 3 and 4 April 1995. The assistant prosecuting officer was the unit adjutant. The applicant, who was legally represented, pleaded not guilty.

During the court-martial hearing, the applicant’s solicitor challenged (under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984) the admission into evidence of the statements of the applicant and his girlfriend. The judge advocate (having heard evidence from the unit adjutant and the applicant’s representative) found that Rule 10 of the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 had been followed. Given the applicant’s legal representation at the relevant time and the procedures followed, the judge advocate could not see “how a fairer situation could have arisen” and, accordingly, he rejected the applicant’s challenge. The judge advocate also clarified during the court martial that “we can take it as an agreed fact that the adjutant or the assistant adjutant will either be the prosecuting or assistant prosecuting officer in any court martial”. The applicant was convicted on the two charges of absence without leave and on one of the charges of desertion, and the remaining charge of desertion was reduced to one of “absent without leave”. He was sentenced to be imprisoned for eight months and to be dismissed from the service, the sentence expressly taking account of the period of close arrest immediately preceding the court martial.

After confirmation and promulgation of the conviction and sentence, the applicant petitioned the Army. By letter dated 13 July 1995 the applicant was informed that his petition to the Army Board had been rejected. His leave application to the single judge of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court was rejected on 13 September 1995 and his further appeal to the full Courts-Martial Appeal Court was also refused on 18 March 1996.

B. The habeas corpus proceedings

The seventy-second day of the applicant’s detention fell on or around 7 February 1995. Accordingly, and pursuant to Rule 6 of the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 and paragraph 6.045(c) of the Queen’s Regulations (see paragraphs 31 and 38 below), a direction from the convening officer was completed on 3 February 1995 attaching an authorisation from the Commander in Chief, the latter of whom directed the applicant’s continued detention “to prevent him absconding” before trial (“the delay report”).

Having requested a copy of the delay report and informed the authorities of his intention to apply for a writ of habeas corpus, the applicant’s solicitor issued those proceedings on 17 February 1995 challenging mainly the regularity of the delay report. That report was received by the applicant’s solicitor on 20 February 1995, following which further submissions were made to the High Court.

On 21 February 1995 the High Court rejected the application. The court found, inter alia, that the delay report had been properly completed in a timely fashion. It noted that the expressed reason for the applicant’s continued detention was to prevent his absconding and found that “perfectly understandable” given the charges against him.","{'applicant': 'David Hood', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'GRANDCHAMBER', 'year': 1999}",001-58913

THE FACTS

I. The CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, David Hood, is a British national born in 1970. He resides in the United Kingdom. At the relevant time, he was a soldier with the regular forces of the British army.

Prior to the events in question, the applicant went absent without leave from his unit in Germany three times. Prior to his third absence, he had been remanded for trial by court martial on an assault charge (later abandoned), he remained absent for almost two and a half years and he gave himself up to the civilian police in December 1993.

A. The relevant detention and court martial of the applicant

On 11 May 1994 the applicant did not return after two weeks’ leave (his fourth absence without leave). On 27 November 1994 he was arrested at his home by the civilian police and on 28 November 1994 he was taken by army escort to Brompton Barracks. Before the Court, the parties disputed whether the applicant was then brought before his commanding officer on 29 November 1994 pursuant to Rule 4 of the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 (see paragraph 29 below).

The applicant remained in close arrest until his court martial. He was detained in a cell in a guardroom under the supervision of a guard apart from certain occasions when he was taken to hospital for psychiatric care.

In or about December 1994 the applicant was informed that he would have to appear before the unit adjutant after Christmas.

He was told that he should read the abstract and check that it was accurate. The applicant was cautioned pursuant to Rule 10 of the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 (see paragraph 32 below).

Acting on his original solicitor’s advice, the applicant prepared his own statement and obtained a statement from his girlfriend, which statements were completed on 4 and 19 January 1995 respectively. The applicant submitted both statements to the adjutant on 20 January 1995, which statements were then attached to the abstract of evidence.

Although the applicant instructed his present solicitor in early February, the latter did not commence work for the applicant until legal aid was granted by the Ministry of Defence by letter dated 14 February 1995.

By notice dated 17 March 1995 a district court martial was convened to try the applicant on the charges. The court martial took place on 3 and 4 April 1995. The assistant prosecuting officer was the unit adjutant. The applicant, who was legally represented, pleaded not guilty.

B. The habeas corpus proceedings

The seventy-second day of the applicant’s detention fell on or around 7 February 1995. Accordingly, and pursuant to Rule 6 of the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 and paragraph 6.045(c) of the Queen’s Regulations (see paragraphs 31 and 38 below), a direction from the convening officer was completed on 3 February 1995 attaching an authorisation from the Commander in Chief, the latter of whom directed the applicant’s continued detention “to prevent him absconding” before trial (“the delay report”).

It originated in an application (no. 27267/95) against the United Kingdom lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 by a British national, Mr David Hood, on 18 April 1995. The Government’s application referred to former Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (former Article 46). Although the Government reserved its position as to whether they would contest the Commission’s opinion as to a violation of Article 5 §§ 3 and 5, the express object of the reference was to obtain a decision as to the amount of just satisfaction, if any, which should be awarded to the applicant under Article 41 of the Convention.

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of former Rules of Court A1, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (former Rule 30).

As President of the Chamber which had originally been constituted (former Article 43 of the Convention and former Rule 21) in order to deal, in particular, with procedural matters that might arise before the entry into force of Protocol No. 11, Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, the Vice-President of the Court at the time, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government and the applicant’s lawyer on the organisation of the written procedure. Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received both the Government’s and the applicant’s memorials on 17 November 1998.

After the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 § 5 thereof, the case was referred to the Grand Chamber of the Court. The Grand Chamber included ex officio Sir Nicolas Bratza, the judge elected in respect of the United Kingdom (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 24 § 4 of the Rules of Court), MrL.Wildhaber, the President of the Court, Mrs E. Palm, Vice-President of the Court, and Mr J.-P. Costa and Mr M.Fischbach, Vice-Presidents of Sections (Article 27 § 3 of the Convention and Rule 24 §§ 3 and 5 (a)). The other members appointed to complete the Grand Chamber were Mr L. Ferrari Bravo, Mr P. Kūris, Mr W. Fuhrmann, Mr K. Jungwiert, Mr B. Zupančič, Mrs N. Vajić, Mr J. Hedigan, Mrs W. Thomassen, Mrs M. Tsatsa-Nikolovska, Mr T. Panţîru, Mr E. Levits and Mr K. Traja (Rule 24 § 3 and Rule 100 § 4). Subsequently Sir Nicolas Bratza, who had taken part in the Commission’s examination of the case, withdrew from sitting in the Grand Chamber (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Sir John Freeland to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).

The President decided that it was not necessary to invite the Commission to delegate one of its members to take part in the proceedings before the Grand Chamber (Rule 99).

In accordance with the President’s decision, a hearing in this case and in the case of Cable and Others v. the United Kingdom took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 9 December 1998. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr C. Whomersley, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr P. Havers QC, Counsel; (b) for the applicant Mr J. Mackenzie, Solicitor, Counsel, Ms K. Duigan, Adviser. The Court heard addresses by Mr Mackenzie and Mr Havers.

THE FACTS

I. The CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, David Hood, is a British national born in 1970. He resides in the United Kingdom. At the relevant time, he was a soldier with the regular forces of the British army.

Prior to the events in question, the applicant went absent without leave from his unit in Germany three times. Prior to his third absence, he had been remanded for trial by court martial on an assault charge (later abandoned), he remained absent for almost two and a half years and he gave himself up to the civilian police in December 1993.

A. The relevant detention and court martial of the applicant

On 11 May 1994 the applicant did not return after two weeks’ leave (his fourth absence without leave). On 27 November 1994 he was arrested at his home by the civilian police and on 28 November 1994 he was taken by army escort to Brompton Barracks. Before the Court, the parties disputed whether the applicant was then brought before his commanding officer on 29 November 1994 pursuant to Rule 4 of the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 (see paragraph 29 below).

The applicant remained in close arrest until his court martial. He was detained in a cell in a guardroom under the supervision of a guard apart from certain occasions when he was taken to hospital for psychiatric care.

In or about December 1994 the applicant was informed that he would have to appear before the unit adjutant after Christmas. He retained a solicitor prior to Christmas, who advised him until 17 January 1995. On 4 January 1995 the applicant appeared before the unit adjutant and was given the abstract of evidence. He was told that he should read the abstract and check that it was accurate. The applicant was cautioned pursuant to Rule 10 of the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 (see paragraph 32 below).

Acting on his original solicitor’s advice, the applicant prepared his own statement and obtained a statement from his girlfriend, which statements were completed on 4 and 19 January 1995 respectively. The applicant submitted both statements to the adjutant on 20 January 1995, which statements were then attached to the abstract of evidence. The applicant was then remanded for trial by court martial by his commanding officer and he applied for legal aid from the military authorities. The charge sheet, dated 25 January 1995 and signed by his commanding officer and on behalf of the convening officer, recorded two charges of absence without leave and two of desertion contrary to the Army Act 1955.

Although the applicant instructed his present solicitor in early February, the latter did not commence work for the applicant until legal aid was granted by the Ministry of Defence by letter dated 14 February 1995.

By notice dated 17 March 1995 a district court martial was convened to try the applicant on the charges. The court martial took place on 3 and 4 April 1995. The assistant prosecuting officer was the unit adjutant. The applicant, who was legally represented, pleaded not guilty.

During the court-martial hearing, the applicant’s solicitor challenged (under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984) the admission into evidence of the statements of the applicant and his girlfriend. The judge advocate (having heard evidence from the unit adjutant and the applicant’s representative) found that Rule 10 of the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 had been followed. Given the applicant’s legal representation at the relevant time and the procedures followed, the judge advocate could not see “how a fairer situation could have arisen” and, accordingly, he rejected the applicant’s challenge. The judge advocate also clarified during the court martial that “we can take it as an agreed fact that the adjutant or the assistant adjutant will either be the prosecuting or assistant prosecuting officer in any court martial”. The applicant was convicted on the two charges of absence without leave and on one of the charges of desertion, and the remaining charge of desertion was reduced to one of “absent without leave”. He was sentenced to be imprisoned for eight months and to be dismissed from the service, the sentence expressly taking account of the period of close arrest immediately preceding the court martial.

After confirmation and promulgation of the conviction and sentence, the applicant petitioned the Army. By letter dated 13 July 1995 the applicant was informed that his petition to the Army Board had been rejected. His leave application to the single judge of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court was rejected on 13 September 1995 and his further appeal to the full Courts-Martial Appeal Court was also refused on 18 March 1996.

B. The habeas corpus proceedings

The seventy-second day of the applicant’s detention fell on or around 7 February 1995. Accordingly, and pursuant to Rule 6 of the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 and paragraph 6.045(c) of the Queen’s Regulations (see paragraphs 31 and 38 below), a direction from the convening officer was completed on 3 February 1995 attaching an authorisation from the Commander in Chief, the latter of whom directed the applicant’s continued detention “to prevent him absconding” before trial (“the delay report”).

Having requested a copy of the delay report and informed the authorities of his intention to apply for a writ of habeas corpus, the applicant’s solicitor issued those proceedings on 17 February 1995 challenging mainly the regularity of the delay report. That report was received by the applicant’s solicitor on 20 February 1995, following which further submissions were made to the High Court.

On 21 February 1995 the High Court rejected the application. The court found, inter alia, that the delay report had been properly completed in a timely fashion. It noted that the expressed reason for the applicant’s continued detention was to prevent his absconding and found that “perfectly understandable” given the charges against him.","{'applicant': 'David Hood', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'GRANDCHAMBER', 'year': 1999}",001-58913

The case originated in two applications (nos. 17019/02 and 30070/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Turkish nationals, Mr Çetin İpek, Mr Murat Özpamuk and Mr Seyithan Demirel (“the applicants”), on 9 February 2002 and 30 April 2002 respectively.

The applicants were represented by Mr M.S. Tanrıkulu, a lawyer practising in Diyarbakır. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

On 17 October 2006 the Court joined the cases, declared them partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the applicants’ complaints under Article 5 §§ 1, 3, 4 and 5 to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicants were born in 1985 and live in Diyarbakır. At the time of the events they were sixteen years old.

According to the official documents, in connection with an ongoing investigation against an illegal armed organisation, namely the PKK (the Workers’ Party of Kurdistan), the police received information that the second applicant, a suspected member of that organisation, had arrived from the rural area in order to conduct activities in cities on behalf of the organisation. Having established the second applicant’s address in Diyarbakır, the police conducted a search of the premises, on 1 December 2001 at 1.20 a.m., and arrested the second applicant. The other applicants, who were also present during the house during the search, were similarly arrested and taken into police custody in order to establish any link they might have had with the organisation. The police did not find anything illegal or incriminating during the search.

On the same night, at around 2.15 a.m., the applicants were taken for a medical examination at the Diyarbakır State Hospital.

According to the custody records, the police informed the fathers’ of first and the third applicant and the second applicant’s mother of their arrest and detention.

On 2 December 2001 the police searched the house of the first applicant but did not find anything illegal or incriminating.

Upon the request of the police, the Diyarbakır public prosecutor (hereinafter the prosecutor) extended the applicants’ detention for two days on 3 December 2001.

On the same day, the applicants were questioned by the police. Since they were accused of offences falling within the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts, they could not benefit from the assistance of a lawyer despite their age.

The custody records noted the end of the applicants’ custody at 10.40 a.m. on 4 December 2001.

Later the same day, the applicants were taken for a medical examination at the Bağlar Medical Clinic.

Afterwards, the applicants were first brought before the prosecutor and then to the Diyarbakır State Security Court (hereinafter the SSC). The latter, after having heard them, ordered their remand in custody.

On 5 December 2001 the prosecutor, relying mainly on the basis of the applicants’ statements obtained during the pre-trial investigation, filed a bill of indictment with the SCC accusing the second applicant of membership of an illegal organisation and the other applicants of aiding and abetting that organisation. The charges were brought under Articles 168 and 169 of the Turkish Criminal Code respectively.

At the first hearing held before the SSC, on 5 February 2002, the applicants were released pending trial.

No further documentation has been submitted by the parties regarding these proceedings before the SSC.","{'applicant': 'Çetin İpek', 'articles': [91, 34, 51, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2009}",001-91063

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Batman.

On 10 April 1997 the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody on suspicion of her involvement in the activities of an illegal organisation, namely the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party). The police officers drew up an arrest protocol in which they noted that they had found a false identity card on the applicant and seized it for the investigation.

Following the Batman public prosecutor's order, the applicant's detention period was extended.

On 15 April 1997 police officers took statements from the applicant. She confessed to being a member of the PKK and stated that she had been involved in armed clashes with the security forces.

On 16 April 1997 the applicant's statements were taken by the Batman public prosecutor to whom she again confessed to being a member of the PKK and stated that she had been involved in political education and propaganda activities for the organisation.

On the same day she was brought before a single judge at the Batman Magistrates' Court who took her statement and ordered her detention on remand.

On 2 May 1997 the principal public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court filed a bill of indictment, charging the applicant under Articles 125 and 40 of the Criminal Code with carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory and aiding and abetting an illegal organisation.

Between 5 May 1997 and 18 April 2000, the Diyarbakır State Security Court held nineteen hearings and heard a number of witnesses. During these hearings, the applicant renounced her statements taken during her detention in police custody. Witnesses heard by the court stated that the applicant was an active member of the PKK and that she had been involved in armed clashes with the security forces.

On 18 April 2000 the Diyarbakır State Security Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced her to death under Article 125 of the Criminal Code. Taking into account her confessions before the court, the death penalty was commuted to a life sentence of imprisonment.

On 19 December 2000 the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the first instance court. It reasoned that the decision was justified as the evidence in the case file was capable of proving that the applicant was an active member of the PKK, which was an armed illegal organisation and carried out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory.

On 24 January 2001 the Court of Cassation's decision was pronounced in the absence of the applicant's representative.","{'applicant': 'Laleş Çeliker', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2007}",001-82485

182,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 316/07) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Ms Serap Demirci (“the applicant”), on 25 December 2006.

The applicant was represented by Mr İ. Akın and Ms N.Ö. Akın, lawyers practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

The applicant alleged that her right of access to court had been breached by a domestic court’s refusal to grant her legal aid.

On 25 May 2010 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Izmir.

On an unspecified date in 2006 she initiated administrative proceedings against the Ege University Hospital, claiming compensation. She indicated, inter alia, that the doctors at the said hospital had not acted diligently during the numerous reconstructive operations she had undergone, which had resulted in severe complications affecting her ears and eyes. The applicant sought a total of 205,000 Turkish liras (TRY) (136,000 euros (EUR) at the time) in compensation for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, submitting medical records in support of her claims. The applicant also applied for legal aid for the required court fees, presenting a certificate from the office of the mayor of the neighbourhood (muhtar) in which she lived attesting to her poverty.

On 26 January 2006 the Izmir Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s legal aid application, after having stated that pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure, an application for legal aid must be supported by proof that the case is well-founded and that the claimant does not have the means to pay the required court fees.

On 6 February 2006 the court informed the applicant that she was required to pay a total of TRY 2,767 (approximately EUR 1,800 at the time) in court fees within thirty days in order for the proceedings to be continued.

Subsequently, on 22 March 2006 the applicant applied for legal aid again and submitted additional documents proving her poor financial situation, including certificates from the Çiğli Directorate of Land Registration, the Revenue Department and the Directorate of Income, which indicated respectively that she did not own any immovable property, had no records in the tax roll and had no income. She also argued that her case was well-founded. On 29 March 2006 her application was rejected once more.

On 17 April 2006 the applicant was warned for the second time that she was required pay the required fees within thirty days in order for the proceedings to be continued.

On 14 June 2006 the Izmir Administrative Court decided to discontinue the compensation proceedings because the applicant had not paid the necessary court fees. That decision was served on the applicant on 29 June 2006.","{'applicant': 'Serap Demirci', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2012}",001-108409
183,"PROCEDURE

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 7 December 1991, within the three-month period laid down in Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 13134/87) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 17 January 1986 by two British citizens, Mrs Wendy Costello-Roberts and her son Jeremy. The expression “the applicant“ hereinafter designates Jeremy, his mother’s complaints having been declared inadmissible by the Commission (see paragraphs 22-23 below). The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 3, 8 and 13 (art. 3, art. 8, art. 13) of the Convention.

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent him (Rule 30).

On 24 January 1992 the President of the Court decided that, pursuant to Rule 21 para. 6 and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, this case and the case of Y v. the United Kingdom should be heard by the same Chamber. Following a friendly settlement, the case of Y was struck out of the list by a judgment dated 29 October 1992 (Series A no. 247-A).

The Chamber to be constituted for this purpose included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 24 January 1992 the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the other seven members, namely Mr J. Cremona, Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr R. Bernhardt, Mr F. Bigi and Mr L. Wildhaber (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). Subsequently Mr F. Matscher, substitute judge, replaced Mr Cremona, whose term of office had expired and whose successor had taken up his duties before the hearing (Rules 2 para. 3 and 22 para. 1).

Mr Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5) and, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government of the United Kingdom (“the Government“), the Delegate of the Commission and the applicant’s representative on the organisation of the procedure (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). In accordance with the order made in consequence, the Registrar received, on 23 June 1992, the applicant’s memorial and, on 22 July, the Government’s. By letter of 17 August 1992, the Secretary to the Commission informed him that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.

In accordance with the decision of the President, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 September 1992. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court:

for the Government Mrs A. Glover, Legal Counsellor, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr N. Bratza, Q.C., Counsel, Mr A. Preston, Department for Education, Mr S. Dance, Department for Education, Advisers;

for the Commission Sir Basil Hall, Delegate;

for the applicant Ms J. Beale, Barrister-at-Law, Counsel, Mr M. Gardner, Solicitor, Mr M. Rosenbaum, Adviser. The Court heard addresses by Mr Bratza for the Government, by Sir Basil Hall for the Commission, and by Ms Beale for the applicant.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

In September 1985 Mrs Costello-Roberts sent the applicant, who was then aged seven, to an independent boarding preparatory school in Barnstaple, Devon. The school had approximately 180 pupils, none of whose fees were paid out of public funds, and received no direct financial support from the Government.

In the school’s prospectus it was stated that a high standard of discipline was maintained, but no mention was made of the use of corporal punishment. Mrs Costello-Roberts had made no enquiry about the school’s disciplinary regime and did not at the outset make known her opposition to corporal punishment. The school in question operated a system whereby such punishment was administered upon acquisition of five demerit marks. On 3 October 1985 the applicant received his fifth demerit mark for talking in the corridor. The other demerit marks were for similar conduct and for being a little late for bed on one occasion. Having discussed the matter with his colleagues, the headmaster decided that the only answer to the applicant’s lack of discipline, about which he had received three warnings from the headmaster, was to give him three “whacks“ on the bottom through his shorts with a rubber-soled gym shoe. He so informed the applicant on 8 October.

The punishment was administered by the headmaster three days later, eight days after Jeremy had received his fifth demerit mark. No other persons were present. Before the Strasbourg institutions it was alleged by the applicant’s counsel that he was told not to inform his parents about his punishment, but this was denied by the school. In any event, in a letter to his mother post-marked 21 October 1985, he wrote “come and picke me up I have had the wacke“. He continued to write to her in some distress about the “slippering“. On 4 November 1985 the school confirmed to her that her son had been slippered; according to her - though this too was contested by the Government - the school had initially denied the fact. On 5 November, Mrs Costello-Roberts wrote to the Governors of the school to express her “disquiet“ and “grave concern“ about the use of such a “barbaric practice“. She acknowledged that the “growing problems“ began after the first week of term and said that “we made it very clear to the staff ... that we considered his behaviour to be reflecting signs of an upset ...“. The headmaster in his turn wrote to the Chairman of the Board of Governors on 7 November, stating that the applicant’s problems were due to a lack of discipline; he refused to accept authority and his behaviour was disrupting the life of the school community. Mrs Costello-Roberts also wrote to the headmaster to inform him that she did not want her son to be corporally punished. On 16 November 1985 he replied as follows: “in view of your obvious dissatisfaction with the education being offered ... to your son ... and your desire for him to be exempt from the framework of discipline and punishment that is acceptable to all other parents at the school, it seems best if [he] is removed from [the school] at the end of the present term.“

The applicant’s mother complained to the police some time between 4 and 16 November 1985, but was told that there was no action they could take without any visible bruising on the child’s buttocks. A complaint by her to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children received a similar response.

The staff were said to have noticed an almost immediate improvement in the boy’s behaviour after the corporal punishment, but considered that the subsequent contact that he had had with his parents during the half-term holiday had caused him to revert. The headmaster was of the opinion that the applicant “strung his parents along“, taking home stories about bullying and the like “which he has clearly made up but which equally clearly his parents believe“. It was argued in Strasbourg, on behalf of the applicant, that he had been extremely disturbed by the slippering, which turned him from a confident, outgoing seven-year-old into a nervous and unsociable child. The Government contended that, according to their information, any change in the child’s character during his time at the school was more likely to have been caused by his inability to adjust to the constraints of boarding-school life than the “slippering“. In their view, the above-mentioned correspondence between the mother, the school Governors and the headmaster reflected the boy’s adaptation difficulties.

The applicant left the Barnstaple school in November 1985 and entered a new school in January 1986. It reported in July 1986 that he had “calmed down considerably“ since his arrival, when he had been unsociable, nervous and quite aggressive.","{'applicant': 'Wendy Costello-Roberts', 'articles': [91, 34, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1993}",001-57804

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 7 December 1991, within the three-month period laid down in Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 13134/87) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 17 January 1986 by two British citizens, Mrs Wendy Costello-Roberts and her son Jeremy. The expression “the applicant“ hereinafter designates Jeremy, his mother’s complaints having been declared inadmissible by the Commission (see paragraphs 22-23 below). The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 3, 8 and 13 (art. 3, art. 8, art. 13) of the Convention.

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent him (Rule 30).

On 24 January 1992 the President of the Court decided that, pursuant to Rule 21 para. 6 and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, this case and the case of Y v. the United Kingdom should be heard by the same Chamber. Following a friendly settlement, the case of Y was struck out of the list by a judgment dated 29 October 1992 (Series A no. 247-A).

The Chamber to be constituted for this purpose included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 24 January 1992 the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the other seven members, namely Mr J. Cremona, Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr R. Bernhardt, Mr F. Bigi and Mr L. Wildhaber (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). Subsequently Mr F. Matscher, substitute judge, replaced Mr Cremona, whose term of office had expired and whose successor had taken up his duties before the hearing (Rules 2 para. 3 and 22 para. 1).

Mr Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5) and, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government of the United Kingdom (“the Government“), the Delegate of the Commission and the applicant’s representative on the organisation of the procedure (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). In accordance with the order made in consequence, the Registrar received, on 23 June 1992, the applicant’s memorial and, on 22 July, the Government’s. By letter of 17 August 1992, the Secretary to the Commission informed him that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.

In accordance with the decision of the President, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 September 1992. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court:

for the Government Mrs A. Glover, Legal Counsellor, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr N. Bratza, Q.C., Counsel, Mr A. Preston, Department for Education, Mr S. Dance, Department for Education, Advisers;

for the Commission Sir Basil Hall, Delegate;

for the applicant Ms J. Beale, Barrister-at-Law, Counsel, Mr M. Gardner, Solicitor, Mr M. Rosenbaum, Adviser. The Court heard addresses by Mr Bratza for the Government, by Sir Basil Hall for the Commission, and by Ms Beale for the applicant.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

In September 1985 Mrs Costello-Roberts sent the applicant, who was then aged seven, to an independent boarding preparatory school in Barnstaple, Devon. The school had approximately 180 pupils, none of whose fees were paid out of public funds, and received no direct financial support from the Government.

In the school’s prospectus it was stated that a high standard of discipline was maintained, but no mention was made of the use of corporal punishment. Mrs Costello-Roberts had made no enquiry about the school’s disciplinary regime and did not at the outset make known her opposition to corporal punishment. The school in question operated a system whereby such punishment was administered upon acquisition of five demerit marks. On 3 October 1985 the applicant received his fifth demerit mark for talking in the corridor. The other demerit marks were for similar conduct and for being a little late for bed on one occasion. Having discussed the matter with his colleagues, the headmaster decided that the only answer to the applicant’s lack of discipline, about which he had received three warnings from the headmaster, was to give him three “whacks“ on the bottom through his shorts with a rubber-soled gym shoe. He so informed the applicant on 8 October.

The punishment was administered by the headmaster three days later, eight days after Jeremy had received his fifth demerit mark. No other persons were present. Before the Strasbourg institutions it was alleged by the applicant’s counsel that he was told not to inform his parents about his punishment, but this was denied by the school. In any event, in a letter to his mother post-marked 21 October 1985, he wrote “come and picke me up I have had the wacke“. He continued to write to her in some distress about the “slippering“. On 4 November 1985 the school confirmed to her that her son had been slippered; according to her - though this too was contested by the Government - the school had initially denied the fact. On 5 November, Mrs Costello-Roberts wrote to the Governors of the school to express her “disquiet“ and “grave concern“ about the use of such a “barbaric practice“. She acknowledged that the “growing problems“ began after the first week of term and said that “we made it very clear to the staff ... that we considered his behaviour to be reflecting signs of an upset ...“. The headmaster in his turn wrote to the Chairman of the Board of Governors on 7 November, stating that the applicant’s problems were due to a lack of discipline; he refused to accept authority and his behaviour was disrupting the life of the school community. Mrs Costello-Roberts also wrote to the headmaster to inform him that she did not want her son to be corporally punished. On 16 November 1985 he replied as follows: “in view of your obvious dissatisfaction with the education being offered ... to your son ... and your desire for him to be exempt from the framework of discipline and punishment that is acceptable to all other parents at the school, it seems best if [he] is removed from [the school] at the end of the present term.“

The applicant’s mother complained to the police some time between 4 and 16 November 1985, but was told that there was no action they could take without any visible bruising on the child’s buttocks. A complaint by her to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children received a similar response.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

In September 1985 Mrs Costello-Roberts sent the applicant, who was then aged seven, to an independent boarding preparatory school in Barnstaple, Devon. The school had approximately 180 pupils, none of whose fees were paid out of public funds, and received no direct financial support from the Government.

In the school’s prospectus it was stated that a high standard of discipline was maintained, but no mention was made of the use of corporal punishment. Mrs Costello-Roberts had made no enquiry about the school’s disciplinary regime and did not at the outset make known her opposition to corporal punishment. The school in question operated a system whereby such punishment was administered upon acquisition of five demerit marks. On 3 October 1985 the applicant received his fifth demerit mark for talking in the corridor. The other demerit marks were for similar conduct and for being a little late for bed on one occasion. Having discussed the matter with his colleagues, the headmaster decided that the only answer to the applicant’s lack of discipline, about which he had received three warnings from the headmaster, was to give him three “whacks“ on the bottom through his shorts with a rubber-soled gym shoe. He so informed the applicant on 8 October.

The punishment was administered by the headmaster three days later, eight days after Jeremy had received his fifth demerit mark. No other persons were present. Before the Strasbourg institutions it was alleged by the applicant’s counsel that he was told not to inform his parents about his punishment, but this was denied by the school. In any event, in a letter to his mother post-marked 21 October 1985, he wrote “come and picke me up I have had the wacke“. He continued to write to her in some distress about the “slippering“. On 4 November 1985 the school confirmed to her that her son had been slippered; according to her - though this too was contested by the Government - the school had initially denied the fact. On 5 November, Mrs Costello-Roberts wrote to the Governors of the school to express her “disquiet“ and “grave concern“ about the use of such a “barbaric practice“. She acknowledged that the “growing problems“ began after the first week of term and said that “we made it very clear to the staff ... that we considered his behaviour to be reflecting signs of an upset ...“. The headmaster in his turn wrote to the Chairman of the Board of Governors on 7 November, stating that the applicant’s problems were due to a lack of discipline; he refused to accept authority and his behaviour was disrupting the life of the school community. Mrs Costello-Roberts also wrote to the headmaster to inform him that she did not want her son to be corporally punished. On 16 November 1985 he replied as follows: “in view of your obvious dissatisfaction with the education being offered ... to your son ... and your desire for him to be exempt from the framework of discipline and punishment that is acceptable to all other parents at the school, it seems best if [he] is removed from [the school] at the end of the present term.“

The applicant’s mother complained to the police some time between 4 and 16 November 1985, but was told that there was no action they could take without any visible bruising on the child’s buttocks. A complaint by her to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children received a similar response.

The staff were said to have noticed an almost immediate improvement in the boy’s behaviour after the corporal punishment, but considered that the subsequent contact that he had had with his parents during the half-term holiday had caused him to revert. The headmaster was of the opinion that the applicant “strung his parents along“, taking home stories about bullying and the like “which he has clearly made up but which equally clearly his parents believe“. It was argued in Strasbourg, on behalf of the applicant, that he had been extremely disturbed by the slippering, which turned him from a confident, outgoing seven-year-old into a nervous and unsociable child. The Government contended that, according to their information, any change in the child’s character during his time at the school was more likely to have been caused by his inability to adjust to the constraints of boarding-school life than the “slippering“. In their view, the above-mentioned correspondence between the mother, the school Governors and the headmaster reflected the boy’s adaptation difficulties.

The applicant left the Barnstaple school in November 1985 and entered a new school in January 1986. It reported in July 1986 that he had “calmed down considerably“ since his arrival, when he had been unsociable, nervous and quite aggressive.","{'applicant': 'Wendy Costello-Roberts', 'articles': [91, 34, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1993}",001-57804
188,"PROCEDURE

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 7 December 1991, within the three-month period laid down in Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 13134/87) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 17 January 1986 by two British citizens, Mrs Wendy Costello-Roberts and her son Jeremy. The expression “the applicant“ hereinafter designates Jeremy, his mother’s complaints having been declared inadmissible by the Commission (see paragraphs 22-23 below). The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 3, 8 and 13 (art. 3, art. 8, art. 13) of the Convention.

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent him (Rule 30).

On 24 January 1992 the President of the Court decided that, pursuant to Rule 21 para. 6 and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, this case and the case of Y v. the United Kingdom should be heard by the same Chamber. Following a friendly settlement, the case of Y was struck out of the list by a judgment dated 29 October 1992 (Series A no. 247-A).

The Chamber to be constituted for this purpose included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 24 January 1992 the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the other seven members, namely Mr J. Cremona, Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr R. Bernhardt, Mr F. Bigi and Mr L. Wildhaber (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). Subsequently Mr F. Matscher, substitute judge, replaced Mr Cremona, whose term of office had expired and whose successor had taken up his duties before the hearing (Rules 2 para. 3 and 22 para. 1).

Mr Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5) and, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government of the United Kingdom (“the Government“), the Delegate of the Commission and the applicant’s representative on the organisation of the procedure (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). In accordance with the order made in consequence, the Registrar received, on 23 June 1992, the applicant’s memorial and, on 22 July, the Government’s. By letter of 17 August 1992, the Secretary to the Commission informed him that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.

In accordance with the decision of the President, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 September 1992. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court:

for the Government Mrs A. Glover, Legal Counsellor, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr N. Bratza, Q.C., Counsel, Mr A. Preston, Department for Education, Mr S. Dance, Department for Education, Advisers;

for the Commission Sir Basil Hall, Delegate;

for the applicant Ms J. Beale, Barrister-at-Law, Counsel, Mr M. Gardner, Solicitor, Mr M. Rosenbaum, Adviser. The Court heard addresses by Mr Bratza for the Government, by Sir Basil Hall for the Commission, and by Ms Beale for the applicant.

The case originated in an application (no. 66446/01) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Mahir Göktaş (“the applicant”), on 4 October 2000.

By a letter dated 21 November 2006, the Registry was informed of the death of the applicant, Mr Mahir Göktaş on 19 August 2006. On 18 December 2006 the applicant's father Mr Muharrem Göktaş and his mother Mrs Fatma Göktaş declared their intention to pursue the application. For practical reasons, Mr Mahir Göktaş will continue to be called “the applicant” in this judgment, although his parents are now to be regarded as such.

The applicant's parents were represented by Mr Terzi, a lawyer practising in İzmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

The applicant alleged that the facts of the case disclosed a breach of Articles 6, 13 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.

On 20 June 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1981 and lived in Izmir.

On 29 December 1995 the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the DHKP-C (Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front). He was fourteen years' old at the time.

On 5 January 1996 the applicant was brought before the İzmir State Security Court and he was placed in detention on remand.

On 15 October 1996, taking into account the applicant's age at the time of the offence, the İzmir State Security Court held that he could not have been aware of the nature and consequences of the offence and decided that there was no need to impose a penalty on him.

On 20 August 1997 the applicant applied to the Bergama Assize Court and sought compensation for both non-pecuniary and pecuniary damage pursuant to Law no. 466 pertaining to the payment of compensation to persons unlawfully arrested or detained.

On 31 March 1998 the Bergama Assize Court awarded the applicant 59,925,000 Turkish Liras (TRL) for pecuniary damage and TRL 150,000,000 for non-pecuniary damage.

On 28 December 1998 the Court of Cassation held that the applicant, who was a student at the time of the events, had not submitted any documents or reasons which could support his pecuniary damage claims. It therefore quashed the judgment of the first instance court.

On 28 January 1999 the proceedings resumed before the Bergama Assize Court. The court decided to hold a hearing on 5 March 1999. The applicant and his representative were summoned to attend the hearing. On 21 February 1999 the applicant's representative submitted a petition to the Court and stated that the applicant should be awarded adequate compensation. Neither the applicant nor his representative attended the hearing which was held before the Bergama Assize Court on 5 March 1999. On 10 March 1999 the Bergama Assize Court awarded the applicant TRL 150,000,000 in respect of non‑pecuniary damage and dismissed his claims for pecuniary damage. The court held that the applicant, who was a student at the time of the events, had not been in paid employment. It further decided not to apply default interest to the sum awarded for non-pecuniary damage.

On 25 April 2000 the Court of Cassation upheld the aforementioned judgment.

On 21 June 2007 the applicant's parents were paid 150 New Turkish liras (YTL)0.","{'applicant': 'Mahir Göktaş', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2007}",001-83613

The case originated in an application (no. 57345/00) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Turkish nationals, Mr Vahdettin Budak, Mr Mehmet Emin Yalçın, Ms Songül Karatağna and Mr Tayyip Ölmez (“the applicants”), on 21 April 2000.

The applicants were represented by Ms T. Aslan, a lawyer practising in İzmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

On 7 September 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the applicants’ right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). The case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicants were born in 1977, 1976, 1974 and 1968 respectively and were serving their prison sentences in Nazilli at the time of their applications to the Court.

The police officers at the Anti-Terror branch of the Antalya Security Directorate arrested Tayyip Ölmez, Vahdettin Budak, Songül Karatağna and Mehmet Emin Yalçın and placed them in custody on 22 February, 13 March, 12 April and 24 April 1998 respectively.

The Antalya Magistrates’ Court ordered the remand in custody of Tayyip Ölmez, Vahdettin Budak, Songül Karatağna and Mehmet Emin Yalçın on 27 February, 22 March, 21 April and 29 April 1998 respectively.

By indictments dated 24 March, 8 May, 17 May and 22 May 1998 the public prosecutor at the İzmir State Security Court accused Vahdettin Budak, Songül Karatağna and Mehmet Emin Yalçın of membership of an illegal organisation and Tayyip Ölmez of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation. He requested that Vahdettin Budak be convicted and sentenced under Article 125 of Criminal Code. In respect of Songül Karatağna and Mehmet Emin Yalçin, the public prosecutor requested that they be convicted and sentenced under Article 168 §2 of Criminal Code and Article 5 of Law no. 3713. As for Tayyip Ölmez, the public prosecutor requested that he be convicted and sentenced under Article 169 of Criminal Code and Article 5 of Law no. 3713.

On 11 November 1998 the İzmir State Security Court convicted the applicants as charged and sentenced Vahdettin Budak to life, Songül Karatağna and Mehmet Emin Yalçın to twelve years and six months and Tayyip Ölmez to five years’ imprisonment.

On 11 October 1999 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the İzmir State Security Court. On 2 November 1999 the judgment of the Court of Cassation was deposited with the registry of the İzmir State Security Court.

On 29 March 2005 the applicants’ representative informed the Court that all the applicants, except for Mr Vahdettin Budak, were released from prison.","{'applicant': 'Vahdettin Budak', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 50, 57, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2006}",001-71938
192,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 34481/97) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Melahat Filiz and Nadir Kalkan (“the applicants”), on 22 November 1996 .

The applicants were represented before the Court by Mr İşeri, a lawyer practising in İzmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

Relying on Article 5 § 3 of the Convention the applicants complained that their detention in police custody lasted eight days without being brought before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr Türmen, the judge elected in respect of Turkey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr F. Gölcüklü to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).

On 14 November 2000 the Chamber retained the applicants' complaint under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.

The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

On 28 July 1996 police officers from the anti-terrorist branch of the İzmir Security Directorate arrested the applicants on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, the PRK-Rızgari.

On 5 August 1996 the İzmir State Security Court ordered the applicants' detention on remand.

On 28 August 1996 the Chief Public Prosecutor filed an indictment with the İzmir State Security Court charging the applicants with membership of the PRK-Rızgari and undertaking actions against the indivisible integrity of the state. The charges were brought under Articles 125 and 168 of the Criminal Code.

In a judgment dated 14 August 1997 the İzmir State Security Court acquitted Ms Melahat Filiz of the charges, holding that there was insufficient evidence to convict her. The court found Mr Nadir Kalkan guilty of the offences under Articles 125 and 168 and sentenced him to capital punishment.

On 19 September 1997 Mr Kalkan lodged an appeal with the Court of Cassation. The applicant did not submit any information concerning the outcome of the criminal proceedings against him.","{'applicant': 'Melahat Filiz', 'articles': [91, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 53, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2002}",001-60516
193,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 40387/06) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Janusz Krawczak (“the applicant”), on 22 September 2006.

The applicant was represented by Mrs M. Sykulska-Przybysz, a lawyer practising in Tczew. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The applicant complained under Article 6 of the excessive length of proceedings and under Article 13 of the Convention that the remedy provided for by the 2004 Act was ineffective because it did not allow a claimant to claim compensation for the delay which occurred before the date of entry into force of the 2004 Act. He also alleged a violation of Article 6 read in conjunction with Article 13 of the Convention in that he had been deprived of his right to have the remedy examined by an impartial court. He contended in this connection that certain judges who had ordered his pre-trial detention to be prolonged had also examined his length of proceedings complaint.

On 12 March 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.

The Government submitted a unilateral declaration and invited the Court to strike out the application, in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Poznań.

A. Criminal proceedings against the applicant

On 17 June 1999 the Gdańsk District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded the applicant in custody for three months on three counts of armed robbery. It considered that that measure was indispensable in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, having regard to the serious nature of the offences in question and the likelihood of a custodial sentence.

The first hearing took place on 28 December 2001. Since that date almost 180 hearings have been scheduled and nearly 400 witnesses heard. Many hearings have been adjourned.

On 21 September 2005 the court decided that, because of the lengthy illness of a judge rapporteur, a new bench should be appointed. This meant that the proceedings had to be restarted.

On 24 November 2005 the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) severed the bill of indictment and ordered that cases against fifteen other co‑accused be tried in separate proceedings.

The proceedings are still pending.

B. Proceedings under the 2004 Act

On 30 January 2006 the applicant lodged a complaint about the undue length of the criminal proceedings under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) and requested just satisfaction of PLN 10,000.

On 23 March 2006 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) dismissed his complaint on the ground that since the date of entry into force of the 2004 Act no undue delays in the proceedings could be discerned, the proceedings having been conducted with due diligence and within a reasonable time. The court observed that the 2004 Act had entered into force on 17 September 2004 and could not be applied to the proceedings before that date.","{'applicant': 'Janusz Krawczak', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 50, 57, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 51, 55, 34, 93], 'countries': 'POL', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-85722
194,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 40387/06) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Janusz Krawczak (“the applicant”), on 22 September 2006.

The applicant was represented by Mrs M. Sykulska-Przybysz, a lawyer practising in Tczew. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The applicant complained under Article 6 of the excessive length of proceedings and under Article 13 of the Convention that the remedy provided for by the 2004 Act was ineffective because it did not allow a claimant to claim compensation for the delay which occurred before the date of entry into force of the 2004 Act. He also alleged a violation of Article 6 read in conjunction with Article 13 of the Convention in that he had been deprived of his right to have the remedy examined by an impartial court. He contended in this connection that certain judges who had ordered his pre-trial detention to be prolonged had also examined his length of proceedings complaint.

On 12 March 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.

The Government submitted a unilateral declaration and invited the Court to strike out the application, in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Poznań.

A. Criminal proceedings against the applicant

On 17 June 1999 the Gdańsk District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded the applicant in custody for three months on three counts of armed robbery. It considered that that measure was indispensable in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, having regard to the serious nature of the offences in question and the likelihood of a custodial sentence.

The first hearing took place on 28 December 2001. Since that date almost 180 hearings have been scheduled and nearly 400 witnesses heard. Many hearings have been adjourned.

On 21 September 2005 the court decided that, because of the lengthy illness of a judge rapporteur, a new bench should be appointed. This meant that the proceedings had to be restarted.

On 24 November 2005 the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) severed the bill of indictment and ordered that cases against fifteen other co‑accused be tried in separate proceedings.

The proceedings are still pending.

B. Proceedings under the 2004 Act

On 30 January 2006 the applicant lodged a complaint about the undue length of the criminal proceedings under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) and requested just satisfaction of PLN 10,000.

On 23 March 2006 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) dismissed his complaint on the ground that since the date of entry into force of the 2004 Act no undue delays in the proceedings could be discerned, the proceedings having been conducted with due diligence and within a reasonable time. The court observed that the 2004 Act had entered into force on 17 September 2004 and could not be applied to the proceedings before that date.","{'applicant': 'Janusz Krawczak', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 50, 57, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 51, 55, 34, 93], 'countries': 'POL', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-85722
195,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 47116/99) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Şemsettin Gümüşten (“the applicant”), on 19 November 1998.

The applicant was represented by Mr Ö. Öneren, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

The applicant alleged under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the criminal proceedings brought against him had not been concluded within a “reasonable time”.

The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).

By a decision of 10 February 2004 the Court declared the application admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Mardin.

On 22 December 1980 the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation.

On 10 March 1981 the Diyarbakır Martial Law Court ordered the applicant's detention on remand.

On 14 September 1981 the public prosecutor's office at the Diyarbakır Martial Law Court filed a bill of indictment with the latter, accusing the applicant of membership of an illegal organisation. The public prosecutor's office requested that the applicant be convicted and sentenced under Article 168 § 1 of the Criminal Code.

On 19 February 1985 the Diyarbakır Martial Law Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to twenty-four years' imprisonment. Before the Diyarbakır Martial Law Court, the applicant was tried together with 624 co-suspects.

Following the applicant's appeal, his case was referred to the Military Court of Cassation.

On 10 April 1990 the Military Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the Diyarbakır Martial Law Court on the ground that latter had misinterpreted the domestic law in respect of the offence in question.

On 29 July 1990 the applicant was released from detention.

Subsequent to promulgation of Law no. 3953 on 27 December 1993, which abolished the jurisdiction of the Martial Law Courts, the Diyarbakır Assize Court acquired jurisdiction over the applicant's case.

On 13 July 1998 the Diyarbakır Assize Court held that the offence fell within the scope of Article 168 § 2 and consequently the statutory time‑limit under Articles 102 and 104 of the Criminal Code had expired. It accordingly ordered that the criminal proceedings against the applicant be terminated.

On 10 September 1998 the judgment became final in respect of the applicant.","{'applicant': 'Şemsettin Gümüşten', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2004}",001-67582
196,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 36273/97) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr Eric Oldham (“the applicant”), on 10 July 1996.

The applicant was represented by Mr R. Atter, a lawyer at Atter MacKenzie, solicitors practising in Evesham, England. The Government of the United Kingdom (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr H. Llewellyn, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant, a discretionary life prisoner who had been released on licence and recalled to prison, made two complaints under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention. He complained, firstly, that he had been denied a fair hearing before the Parole Board on 8 November 1996 and, secondly, that he had not had his detention reviewed until just over two years later.

On 22 October 1998 the Commission decided to give notice of the application to the Government and invited them to submit their observations on its admissibility and merits. The Government submitted their observations on 19 March 1999, after an extension of the time-limit fixed for that purpose, to which the applicant replied on 4 May 1999.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11). The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court).

On 7 March 2000 the Court declared the complaint concerning the fairness of the Parole Board hearing inadmissible. It declared admissible the complaint concerning the delay between reviews [ Note by the Registry. The Court's decision is obtainable from the Registry.].

The Registrar received the applicant's and the Government's further comments on 19 May 2000 and 7 June 2000 respectively.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

In April 1970 the applicant, then aged 21, was convicted of manslaughter, qualified as such on the grounds of diminished responsibility, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Medical evidence adduced at the trial showed that the applicant suffered from a mental abnormality induced by alcohol.

On 27 July 1993 the applicant was released on life licence for the third time subject to the condition, amongst others, that he should comply with any reasonable requirement imposed by his probation officer for the treatment of his alcohol problem. He had been recalled to prison twice previously and had since been transferred to open prison conditions in 1989.

On 1 July 1996 the police were called to the home of the applicant's partner, M., who is a deaf mute. She was taken to hospital where she received treatment for injuries to her face and back.

On 2 July 1996 the Secretary of State revoked the applicant's licence and recalled him to prison. By a letter dated 4 July 1996, the Secretary of State indicated that the licence was revoked on the grounds that the applicant had caused M.'s injuries after drinking at least eight cans of lager. This was so stated in the report by the applicant's probation officer who had met with M. on 2 July 1996. The case was referred to the Parole Board which confirmed the revocation of the applicant's licence on 12 July 1996.

On 8 November 1996 the Parole Board's Discretionary Lifer Panel (“the DLP”), chaired by a High Court judge, met to consider the applicant's representations against recall. It considered the applicant's written and oral representations, the views of two probation officers, the oral evidence of M. and the submissions of the applicant's solicitor and counsel for the Secretary of State. In her oral evidence M. gave evidence to the effect that it had been she and not the applicant who had been responsible for her injuries. A prison officer, who had attained a stage 1 British Sign Language qualification and was training towards stage 2, attended the hearing and acted as interpreter for M.

In its written decision of 12 November 1996 the DLP stated, in its reasons for rejecting the applicant's representations, that it had accepted the evidence which indicated that the applicant had been responsible for M.'s injuries, rather than the account put forward on behalf of the applicant. It expressed the opinion that, in order to minimise the risk posed by the applicant to members of the public, the applicant needed to carry out further work in respect of alcohol, anger and relationships. This was communicated to the applicant in a letter dated 15 November 1996 by the Secretary of State, who informed the applicant that his next Parole Board review was set for November 1998.

The applicant and M. married in prison on 6 February 1997.

The applicant applied for legal aid to challenge the DLP's decision by judicial review. On appeal, legal aid was granted for the limited purpose of seeking further evidence and counsel's opinion. On 15 March 1997, counsel advised that an application for judicial review would be unsuccessful and legal aid was not extended.

While in prison, the applicant attended courses in anger management, relationships, alcohol awareness and men and violence run by the Manchester Probation Service. These had been completed within eight months of his recall.

On 7 December 1998 the applicant had a further hearing before the DLP. Despite expressing some reservations, the DLP concluded that the applicant had made significant and sufficient progress since his previous review and recommended to the Secretary of State that he be released on licence. The applicant was released on 17 December 1998.","{'applicant': 'Eric Oldham', 'articles': [91, 34, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2000}",001-58807

The applicant was represented by Mr R. Atter, a lawyer at Atter MacKenzie, solicitors practising in Evesham, England. The Government of the United Kingdom (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr H. Llewellyn, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant, a discretionary life prisoner who had been released on licence and recalled to prison, made two complaints under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention. He complained, firstly, that he had been denied a fair hearing before the Parole Board on 8 November 1996 and, secondly, that he had not had his detention reviewed until just over two years later.

On 22 October 1998 the Commission decided to give notice of the application to the Government and invited them to submit their observations on its admissibility and merits. The Government submitted their observations on 19 March 1999, after an extension of the time-limit fixed for that purpose, to which the applicant replied on 4 May 1999.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11). The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court).

On 7 March 2000 the Court declared the complaint concerning the fairness of the Parole Board hearing inadmissible. It declared admissible the complaint concerning the delay between reviews [ Note by the Registry. The Court's decision is obtainable from the Registry.].

The Registrar received the applicant's and the Government's further comments on 19 May 2000 and 7 June 2000 respectively.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

In April 1970 the applicant, then aged 21, was convicted of manslaughter, qualified as such on the grounds of diminished responsibility, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Medical evidence adduced at the trial showed that the applicant suffered from a mental abnormality induced by alcohol.

On 27 July 1993 the applicant was released on life licence for the third time subject to the condition, amongst others, that he should comply with any reasonable requirement imposed by his probation officer for the treatment of his alcohol problem. He had been recalled to prison twice previously and had since been transferred to open prison conditions in 1989.

On 1 July 1996 the police were called to the home of the applicant's partner, M., who is a deaf mute. She was taken to hospital where she received treatment for injuries to her face and back.

On 2 July 1996 the Secretary of State revoked the applicant's licence and recalled him to prison. By a letter dated 4 July 1996, the Secretary of State indicated that the licence was revoked on the grounds that the applicant had caused M.'s injuries after drinking at least eight cans of lager. This was so stated in the report by the applicant's probation officer who had met with M. on 2 July 1996. The case was referred to the Parole Board which confirmed the revocation of the applicant's licence on 12 July 1996.

On 8 November 1996 the Parole Board's Discretionary Lifer Panel (“the DLP”), chaired by a High Court judge, met to consider the applicant's representations against recall. It considered the applicant's written and oral representations, the views of two probation officers, the oral evidence of M. and the submissions of the applicant's solicitor and counsel for the Secretary of State. In her oral evidence M. gave evidence to the effect that it had been she and not the applicant who had been responsible for her injuries. A prison officer, who had attained a stage 1 British Sign Language qualification and was training towards stage 2, attended the hearing and acted as interpreter for M.

In its written decision of 12 November 1996 the DLP stated, in its reasons for rejecting the applicant's representations, that it had accepted the evidence which indicated that the applicant had been responsible for M.'s injuries, rather than the account put forward on behalf of the applicant. It expressed the opinion that, in order to minimise the risk posed by the applicant to members of the public, the applicant needed to carry out further work in respect of alcohol, anger and relationships. This was communicated to the applicant in a letter dated 15 November 1996 by the Secretary of State, who informed the applicant that his next Parole Board review was set for November 1998.

The applicant and M. married in prison on 6 February 1997.

The applicant applied for legal aid to challenge the DLP's decision by judicial review. On appeal, legal aid was granted for the limited purpose of seeking further evidence and counsel's opinion. On 15 March 1997, counsel advised that an application for judicial review would be unsuccessful and legal aid was not extended.

While in prison, the applicant attended courses in anger management, relationships, alcohol awareness and men and violence run by the Manchester Probation Service. These had been completed within eight months of his recall.

On 7 December 1998 the applicant had a further hearing before the DLP. Despite expressing some reservations, the DLP concluded that the applicant had made significant and sufficient progress since his previous review and recommended to the Secretary of State that he be released on licence. The applicant was released on 17 December 1998.","{'applicant': 'Eric Oldham', 'articles': [91, 34, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2000}",001-58807

The case originated in two applications (nos. 31145/96 and 35580/97) against the United Kingdom lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two British nationals, Mr Mark Wilkinson and Mr Kevin Allen (“the applicants”), on 13 April 1996 and 1 April 1997, respectively.

The applicants were represented by Mr J. Mackenzie, a lawyer practising in London. The British Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mr M. Eaton and Mr C. Whomersley, both of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicants alleged, as regards their trial by court-martial, that they did not have a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. On 31 May 1999 the Commission found a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. By letter dated 27 September 1999 the Government referred the cases to the Court explaining that the reference had been made not to contest the breach of Article 6 § 1 which had been found by the Commission but to seek a ruling pursuant to Article 41 on what just satisfaction, if any, should be awarded to the applicants.

In accordance with Article 5 § 4 of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention and Rules 100 § 1 and 24 § 6 of the Rules of Court, a panel of the Grand Chamber decided on 13 December 1999 that the applications should be considered by a Chamber constituted within one of the Sections of the Court. The applications were then allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Sir Nicolas Bratza, the judge elected in respect of the United Kingdom, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). While the Government initially appointed Sir Stephen Richards to sit as an ad hoc judge, by letter dated 9 November 2000 they agreed that Judge Costa, the judge elected in respect of France, would sit in place of Sir Nicolas Bratza (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).

The Chamber decided to join the proceedings in the applications (Rule 43 § 1).

The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine).

At the time of the events in question, both applicants were serving in the army and were tried by district courts-martial convened pursuant to the Army Act 1955.

Mr Wilkinson pleaded guilty to the armed forces’ disciplinary offence of absence without leave (contrary to section 38(a) of the Army Act 1955). Although the Army Board upheld his petition against the custodial part of his sentence, the charge for which he was convicted carried a potential sentence of two years’ imprisonment (see paragraph 17 below).

Mr Allen pleaded guilty to two charges of possession of controlled drugs contrary to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, these being civilian criminal offences.

In accordance with Article 5 § 4 of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention and Rules 100 § 1 and 24 § 6 of the Rules of Court, a panel of the Grand Chamber decided on 13 December 1999 that the applications should be considered by a Chamber constituted within one of the Sections of the Court. The applications were then allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Sir Nicolas Bratza, the judge elected in respect of the United Kingdom, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). While the Government initially appointed Sir Stephen Richards to sit as an ad hoc judge, by letter dated 9 November 2000 they agreed that Judge Costa, the judge elected in respect of France, would sit in place of Sir Nicolas Bratza (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).

The Chamber decided to join the proceedings in the applications (Rule 43 § 1).

The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES

At the time of the events in question, both applicants were serving in the army and were tried by district courts-martial convened pursuant to the Army Act 1955.

Mr Wilkinson pleaded guilty to the armed forces’ disciplinary offence of absence without leave (contrary to section 38(a) of the Army Act 1955). Although the Army Board upheld his petition against the custodial part of his sentence, the charge for which he was convicted carried a potential sentence of two years’ imprisonment (see paragraph 17 below).

Mr Allen pleaded guilty to two charges of possession of controlled drugs contrary to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, these being civilian criminal offences. The Army Board reduced the custodial element of his sentence to six months’ imprisonment.","{'applicant': 'Mark Wilkinson', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2001}",001-59205

211,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 16651/05) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by six Polish nationals, Ms Barbara Czajkowska, Mr Tadeusz Korsak, Ms Danuta Korsak, Mr Tadeusz Łagowski, Mr Tomasz Świeczak, and Ms Agata Wicherek (“the applicants”), on 9 April 2005.

The applicants were represented by Mr P. Paluch, a lawyer practising in Kraków. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The applicants alleged, in particular, that the length of administrative proceedings in their case exceeded a “reasonable time”. They also alleged that the delay in payment of compensation amounted to a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.

On 11 September 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicants, Ms Barbara Czajkowska, Mr Tadeusz Korsak, Ms Danuta Korsak, Mr Tadeusz Łagowski, Mr Tomasz Świeczak, and Ms Agata Wicherek, are Polish nationals who were born in 1963, 1926, 1925, 1927, 1956 and 1963 respectively and live in Warsaw. They were represented before the Court by the first applicant, Ms Barbara Czajkowska.

Ms Wacława Korsak, the first applicant's grandmother, owned a plot of agricultural land measuring a total surface area of 46,000 sq. m located in Warsaw. The applicants are Ms Wacława Korsak's heirs.

By virtue of the Decree of 26 October 1945 on the Ownership and Use of Land in Warsaw, ownership of all private land was transferred to the City of Warsaw. Subsequently, under section 32(2) of the Law of 20 March 1950 on Local Organs of the Uniform State Power (ustawa o terenowych organach jednolitej władzy państwowej), all this land became the property of the State Treasury.

In 1961 Ms Wacława Korsak applied for compensation for the nationalised property.

On 13 February 1965 the Board of the Warsaw National Council (Prezydium Rady Narodowej) granted the application in part and awarded Ms Korsak compensation for 23,000 sq. m of the land in question.

On 20 November 1969 the Board awarded further compensation for a house and trees under section 53(1) of the Expropriation of Property (Conditions and Procedures) Act of 12 March 1958. The decision contained a statement that the question of compensation for the remaining part of the land would be decided at a later stage. That decision was amended in 1970 as regards the amount of the compensation awarded to the first applicant's grandmother.

On 29 March 1978 Ms Wacława Korsak's son, Mr Jerzy Korsak, applied for compensation for the remaining part of the property. It appears that other applicants joined the proceedings and that between 1991 and 2007 they made repeated requests for compensation.

In 1992 the administrative proceedings, pending before the Warsaw District Office (Urząd Rejonowy), were stayed.

In 1998 the second applicant lodged a complaint about the inactivity of the Mayor of Warsaw (Prezydent Miasta Warszawy), but this was dismissed by the Supreme Administrative Court on 11 March 1998.

In the meantime, on 15 January 1998, the Head of the Warsaw District Office had informed the Supreme Administrative Court that the administrative proceedings concerning the property in question had now been completed. The Office did not, however, have the necessary financial means to pay the compensation under section 215(1) of the 1997 Land Administration Act. The letter then stated: “In the light of the above, payment of the compensation could be finalised after the Office receives the necessary funds.”

The Warsaw District Office having failed to reach a decision, the applicants lodged a complaint about its inactivity with the Supreme Administrative Court.

On 8 May 2003 the court allowed the complaint and ordered the District Office to issue a decision regarding the applicants' claim for compensation within two months.

Subsequently, the Mayor of Warsaw resumed the proceedings, and then discontinued them on 30 September 2003. The applicants appealed.

On 6 February 2004 the Mazowiecki Governor (Wojewoda) quashed the impugned decision and remitted the case for fresh consideration.

On 27 May 2005 the Mayor of Warsaw gave a decision in which he dismissed the application for compensation. The Mayor relied on section 215(1) of the 1997 Land Administration Act and considered that the applicants had not fulfilled the legal requirements and could not therefore be awarded compensation.

The applicants appealed, but their appeal was dismissed by the Mazowiecki Governor on 14 February 2006. They lodged a complaint with the Regional Administrative Court (Wojewódzki Sąd Administracyjny) against that decision.

On 18 October 2006 the Regional Administrative Court allowed the complaint and quashed both impugned decisions.

The applicants complained about the Mayor of Warsaw's inactivity and asked the Regional Administrative Court to fine the Mayor for having failed to implement the Supreme Administrative Court's decision of 8 May 2003. However, on 30 October 2007 the applicants withdrew their application apparently because in the meantime the Mayor had given a decision. On the same day – that is, on 30 October 2007 – the Regional Administrative Court discontinued the proceedings.

On 17 October 2007 the Mayor of Warsaw gave a decision, under section 215(1) of the 1997 Land Administration Act, in which he agreed to pay the applicants compensation for a part of the property measuring 11,400 sq. m. The Mayor considered that this part of the property had been agricultural land and that the conditions for payment of the compensation under the above provision had thus been fulfilled. The total compensation paid (PLN 5,782,335) was divided among Ms Barbara Czajkowska, Mr Tadeusz Korsak, Mr Tomasz Świeczak and Ms Agata Wicherek according to their share in Ms Wacława Korsak's estate. The two remaining applicants, Ms Danuta Korsak and Mr Tadeusz Łagowski, were not parties to the proceedings at that stage as they had either donated or sold their shares in the inheritance to the other applicants. The Mayor also decided that the application regarding compensation for the remaining part of the property, measuring 13,208 sq. m, would be settled at a later stage.

The applicants did not appeal against that decision.

On 20 January 2009 the Mayor of Warsaw gave a further decision, under section 215(1) of the 1997 Land Administration Act, in which he agreed to pay the applicants compensation for a part of the property measuring 12,009 sq. m. The Mayor considered that this part of the property had been agricultural land and that the conditions for payment of the compensation under the above-mentioned provision had thus been fulfilled. The total compensation paid (PLN 6,376,779) was divided among Ms Barbara Czajkowska, Mr Tadeusz Korsak, Mr Tomasz Świeczak and Ms Agata Wicherek according to their share in Ms Wacława Korsak's estate. The Mayor also decided that the application regarding compensation for the remaining (and last) part of the property, measuring 1,103 sq. m, would be settled at a later stage by a separate decision.

The proceedings regarding this part of the applicants' claim are pending.","{'applicant': 'Barbara Czajkowska', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'POL', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2010}",001-99929
212,"PROCEDURE

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) and by the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden (“the Government“) on 8 and 28 June 1990 respectively, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention“). It originated in an application (no. 11274/84) against Sweden lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by Mr Jan-Åke Andersson, a Swedish national, on 16 October 1984. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request and of the Government’s application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).

On 30 June 1990 the President of the Court decided under Rule 21 para. 6 and in the interest of sound administration of justice, that a single Chamber should be constituted to consider both the instant case and the Fejde case. The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mrs E. Palm, the elected judge of Swedish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention)2 (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On the same day, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mrs D. Bindschedler-Robert, Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr J. Pinheiro Farinha, Mr R. Bernhardt, Mr J. De Meyer, Mr S.K. Martens and Mr J.M. Morenilla (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).

Mr Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5) and, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicant on the need for a written procedure (Rule 37 para. 1). Thereafter, in accordance with the President’s orders, the Registrar received on 8 October 1990 the Government’s memorial, on 8 and 22 April 1991 the applicant’s claims under Article 50 (art. 50) and on 15 March and 22 April 1991 certain documents from the files of the Commission. In a letter of 12 November 1990 the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit her observations at the hearing.

Having consulted, through the Registrar, those who would be appearing before the Court, the President directed on 15 November 1990 that the oral proceedings should open on 22 April 1991 (Rule 38).

On 23 November 1990 the Chamber decided unanimously, under Rule 51, to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court.

The hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court:

for the Government Mr H. Corell, Ambassador, Under-Secretary for Legal and Consular Affairs, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Agent, Ms A.-S. Broqvist, Legal Adviser, Ministry of Justice, Ms E. Jagander, Legal Adviser, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Advisers;

for the Commission Mrs G.H. Thune, Delegate;

for the applicant Mr C. Arnewid, advokat, Counsel, Mr L. Hök, advokat, Adviser. The Court heard addresses by Mr Corell for the Government, Mrs Thune for the Commission and Mr Arnewid for the applicant, as well as their replies to its questions.

At the final deliberations Mr Cremona, the Vice-President of the Court, replaced Mr Ryssdal as President, the latter being unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rule 9).

AS TO THE FACTS

I. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

Mr Jan-Åke Andersson, a Swedish citizen, is an engineer by profession and resides in Torsås in the South-West of Sweden.

On 26 February 1983 the applicant was stopped by police inspector B. while driving a tractor on a highway (motortrafikled), on which this was prohibited under the Traffic Ordinance of 1972 (vägtrafikkungörelsen 1972:603 - “the 1972 Ordinance“). He refused to pay a fine, maintaining that he had not seen any road sign indicating the category of the road or the prohibition in question.

On 17 May 1983 Mr Andersson was summoned to appear before the District Court (tingsrätten) of Ronneby, charged with having contravened sections 139 and 144 of the 1972 Ordinance. In a letter to the District Court he stated that he expected the public prosecutor to call certain police officers, including police inspector B., as witnesses, as he could not afford to call any himself. Moreover, the public prosecutor should, he said, produce the relevant official meteorological records (see the extracts from the District Court’s judgment in paragraph 12 below). In addition, he requested the District Court to appoint an official defence counsel. On 8 June 1983 this request was refused by the District Court, which considered that the case was simple and that the applicant was able to defend himself. His appeal against this decision was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (hovrätten) of Skåne and Blekinge on 15 June 1983, with no possibility of further appeal.

On 21 September 1983 the District Court held a hearing (huvudförhandling) during which both the applicant and police inspector B. were heard. It did not, however, order the production of the relevant meteorological records. On the same day it found the applicant guilty of the charge brought against him and sentenced him to a fine of 400 Swedish kronor. In its judgment the District Court stated: “[The applicant] has contested criminal liability and has made the following statement: He was on his way from Hässleholm to Torsås driving a tractor that he had just bought. He had travelled with his father to Hässleholm that morning and they had then, inter alia, travelled the same road but in the opposite direction. The mist had been very dense already in the morning and [the applicant] had observed nothing special as regards the road during the trip. He does not know what the concept ‘motortrafikled’ means. When he arrived on the ‘motortrafikled’ west of Karlshamn it was so misty that he saw no road signs that attracted his attention. He was therefore unaware of the character of the road he was driving on and even if he had noticed a road sign indicating ‘motortrafikled’ he would not have known what restrictions this would imply as regards driving certain vehicles. Police inspector B. has been heard as a witness but has not given any information other than that the weather was normal in the area of Ronneby without any signs of mist. [The applicant] - who was driving as alleged by the public prosecutor - drove a long distance by tractor and should therefore have paid particular attention to the rules applicable as regards the driving of such a vehicle. The fact that the weather was misty does not relieve him from his obligations as a driver. He shall therefore be convicted in accordance with the charge against him.“

On 4 October 1983 the applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal of Skåne and Blekinge. He claimed that the proceedings before the District Court had been “unbalanced“ and that numerous “interruptions“ by the judge had prevented him from following the arguments and from presenting his case in a satisfactory manner; that the fine imposed was far too high; and furthermore, that the District Court had overlooked the fact that certain road signs had been missing. In his reply of 31 October 1983, the public prosecutor, referring to the evidence submitted before the District Court, maintained that the applicant was guilty and expressed the opinion that it was not necessary to hold a new hearing. On 2 November the Court of Appeal sent a copy of this reply to the applicant, advising him that since the case could be adjudicated without a new hearing, he was entitled to submit final written observations within two weeks. In his final observations of 9 November 1983, Mr Andersson asked the Court of Appeal to take the absence of certain road signs into account and to consider the weather situation and the fact that he was overtaken by an unmarked police car which failed to warn him. He also applied for a public hearing to be held in Karlskrona, for police inspector B. to be heard as a witness and for the relevant meteorological records to be examined. In addition, he requested free legal assistance since he needed defence counsel and did not have sufficient means to pay for one.

The Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s requests and decided the case on the basis of the case-file. In its judgment of 10 February 1984, upholding the findings of the District Court, it stated: “From the photos which have been referred to, it appears that the fact that the road in question was a ‘motortrafikled’ did appear from appropriate and visible road signs at Stensnäs. For this reason and since [the applicant] nevertheless drove the tractor on [the road] from Stensnäs to Sörby, he committed the offence with which he has been charged by the prosecution.“

Mr Andersson applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court (högsta domstolen), claiming that the appeal proceedings had been very “unbalanced“ and had not complied with human-rights standards. The Supreme Court refused the application on 26 April 1984.

Under the rules on public access to official documents, contained in the Freedom of the Press Act 1949 (tryckfrihetsförordningen) and the Secrecy Act (sekretesslagen, 1980:100), the case-files from the courts involved were all accessible to the public.","{'applicant': 'Jan-Åke Andersson', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1991}",001-57698

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) and by the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden (“the Government“) on 8 and 28 June 1990 respectively, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention“). It originated in an application (no. 11274/84) against Sweden lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by Mr Jan-Åke Andersson, a Swedish national, on 16 October 1984.

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).

On 30 June 1990 the President of the Court decided under Rule 21 para. 6 and in the interest of sound administration of justice, that a single Chamber should be constituted to consider both the instant case and the Fejde case. The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mrs E. Palm, the elected judge of Swedish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention)2 (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On the same day, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mrs D. Bindschedler-Robert, Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr J. Pinheiro Farinha, Mr R. Bernhardt, Mr J. De Meyer, Mr S.K. Martens and Mr J.M. Morenilla (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).

Mr Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5) and, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicant on the need for a written procedure (Rule 37 para. 1). Thereafter, in accordance with the President’s orders, the Registrar received on 8 October 1990 the Government’s memorial, on 8 and 22 April 1991 the applicant’s claims under Article 50 (art. 50) and on 15 March and 22 April 1991 certain documents from the files of the Commission. In a letter of 12 November 1990 the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit her observations at the hearing.

Having consulted, through the Registrar, those who would be appearing before the Court, the President directed on 15 November 1990 that the oral proceedings should open on 22 April 1991 (Rule 38).

On 23 November 1990 the Chamber decided unanimously, under Rule 51, to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court.

The hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court:

for the Government Mr H. Corell, Ambassador, Under-Secretary for Legal and Consular Affairs, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Agent, Ms A.-S. Broqvist, Legal Adviser, Ministry of Justice, Ms E. Jagander, Legal Adviser, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Advisers;

for the Commission Mrs G.H. Thune, Delegate;

for the applicant Mr C. Arnewid, advokat, Counsel, Mr L. Hök, advokat, Adviser. The Court heard addresses by Mr Corell for the Government, Mrs Thune for the Commission and Mr Arnewid for the applicant, as well as their replies to its questions.

At the final deliberations Mr Cremona, the Vice-President of the Court, replaced Mr Ryssdal as President, the latter being unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rule 9).

AS TO THE FACTS

I. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

Mr Jan-Åke Andersson, a Swedish citizen, is an engineer by profession and resides in Torsås in the South-West of Sweden.

On 26 February 1983 the applicant was stopped by police inspector B. while driving a tractor on a highway (motortrafikled), on which this was prohibited under the Traffic Ordinance of 1972 (vägtrafikkungörelsen 1972:603 - “the 1972 Ordinance“). He refused to pay a fine, maintaining that he had not seen any road sign indicating the category of the road or the prohibition in question.

On 17 May 1983 Mr Andersson was summoned to appear before the District Court (tingsrätten) of Ronneby, charged with having contravened sections 139 and 144 of the 1972 Ordinance. In a letter to the District Court he stated that he expected the public prosecutor to call certain police officers, including police inspector B., as witnesses, as he could not afford to call any himself. Moreover, the public prosecutor should, he said, produce the relevant official meteorological records (see the extracts from the District Court’s judgment in paragraph 12 below). In addition, he requested the District Court to appoint an official defence counsel. On 8 June 1983 this request was refused by the District Court, which considered that the case was simple and that the applicant was able to defend himself. His appeal against this decision was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (hovrätten) of Skåne and Blekinge on 15 June 1983, with no possibility of further appeal.

On 21 September 1983 the District Court held a hearing (huvudförhandling) during which both the applicant and police inspector B. were heard. It did not, however, order the production of the relevant meteorological records. On the same day it found the applicant guilty of the charge brought against him and sentenced him to a fine of 400 Swedish kronor. In its judgment the District Court stated: “[The applicant] has contested criminal liability and has made the following statement: He was on his way from Hässleholm to Torsås driving a tractor that he had just bought. He had travelled with his father to Hässleholm that morning and they had then, inter alia, travelled the same road but in the opposite direction. The mist had been very dense already in the morning and [the applicant] had observed nothing special as regards the road during the trip. He does not know what the concept ‘motortrafikled’ means. When he arrived on the ‘motortrafikled’ west of Karlshamn it was so misty that he saw no road signs that attracted his attention. He was therefore unaware of the character of the road he was driving on and even if he had noticed a road sign indicating ‘motortrafikled’ he would not have known what restrictions this would imply as regards driving certain vehicles. Police inspector B. has been heard as a witness but has not given any information other than that the weather was normal in the area of Ronneby without any signs of mist. [The applicant] - who was driving as alleged by the public prosecutor - drove a long distance by tractor and should therefore have paid particular attention to the rules applicable as regards the driving of such a vehicle. The fact that the weather was misty does not relieve him from his obligations as a driver. He shall therefore be convicted in accordance with the charge against him.“

On 4 October 1983 the applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal of Skåne and Blekinge. He claimed that the proceedings before the District Court had been “unbalanced“ and that numerous “interruptions“ by the judge had prevented him from following the arguments and from presenting his case in a satisfactory manner; that the fine imposed was far too high; and furthermore, that the District Court had overlooked the fact that certain road signs had been missing. In his reply of 31 October 1983, the public prosecutor, referring to the evidence submitted before the District Court, maintained that the applicant was guilty and expressed the opinion that it was not necessary to hold a new hearing. On 2 November the Court of Appeal sent a copy of this reply to the applicant, advising him that since the case could be adjudicated without a new hearing, he was entitled to submit final written observations within two weeks. In his final observations of 9 November 1983, Mr Andersson asked the Court of Appeal to take the absence of certain road signs into account and to consider the weather situation and the fact that he was overtaken by an unmarked police car which failed to warn him. He also applied for a public hearing to be held in Karlskrona, for police inspector B. to be heard as a witness and for the relevant meteorological records to be examined. In addition, he requested free legal assistance since he needed defence counsel and did not have sufficient means to pay for one.

The Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s requests and decided the case on the basis of the case-file. In its judgment of 10 February 1984, upholding the findings of the District Court, it stated: “From the photos which have been referred to, it appears that the fact that the road in question was a ‘motortrafikled’ did appear from appropriate and visible road signs at Stensnäs. For this reason and since [the applicant] nevertheless drove the tractor on [the road] from Stensnäs to Sörby, he committed the offence with which he has been charged by the prosecution.“

Mr Andersson applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court (högsta domstolen), claiming that the appeal proceedings had been very “unbalanced“ and had not complied with human-rights standards. The Supreme Court refused the application on 26 April 1984.

Under the rules on public access to official documents, contained in the Freedom of the Press Act 1949 (tryckfrihetsförordningen) and the Secrecy Act (sekretesslagen, 1980:100), the case-files from the courts involved were all accessible to the public.","{'applicant': 'Jan-Åke Andersson', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1991}",001-57698

The case originated in an application (no. 74961/01) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Alan Nelson (“the applicant”) on 4 October 2001.

The applicant was represented before the Court by Ms Jacky Starling, a lawyer practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

By a decision of 10 September 2002 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning widows’ benefits and to declare the remainder of the application inadmissible. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it subsequently decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in İstanbul.

On 8 September 1999 at 5.15 a.m. the applicant was arrested by police officers from the anti-terror branch of the Istanbul Security Directorate on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party). According to the arrest protocol, the police officers had to use force to apprehend the applicant since he resisted the arrest. The applicant refrained from signing this document. The applicant alleged that, contrary to what was indicated in the arrest protocol, he had been arrested on 5 September 1999.

Following his arrest, the applicant was blindfolded, put in a car and threats were uttered against him. After being driven around for some time, still blindfolded, he was taken to the anti-terror branch of the Istanbul Security Directorate. There, the applicant was allegedly punched, kicked, beaten on the head and the back with a truncheon and threatened with death. He also alleged that his testicles were squeezed.

On 8 September 1999 at 7.10 a.m. the applicant was examined by a doctor in the Haseki State Hospital who noted an ecchymosis of 9 x 3 cm on the left of the lower part of his abdominal region. The doctor concluded that there were marks of physical violence on the applicant's body and considered that he should be examined by an urologist. On the same day at 7.25 a.m. the applicant was examined by an urologist who found, by using the technique of palpation, that the applicant's testicles were painful and sensitive.

On 9 September 1999 the applicant was again examined by a general practitioner in the Haseki State Hospital who considered that the applicant should be taken to an internist. According to the report drawn up by the doctor, the applicant was brought to him as he was on a hunger strike in police custody. The applicant was then taken back to the Security Directorate.

On 11 September 1999 the applicant was again examined by a general practitioner in the Haseki State Hospital who noted that the applicant was brought before him because of hunger strike. The doctor considered that the applicant should be examined by an internist. On the same day, the applicant underwent a blood test.

On 12 September 1999 the applicant was examined by a doctor in the Haseki State Hospital who noted that there was no sign of physical violence on his body.

On the same day, the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court. In his statement, he maintained that he had been subjected to ill-treatment while in police custody and that, therefore, he had started a hunger strike. Subsequently, on the same day, the applicant was brought before the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court. Before the judge, the applicant maintained that he had been kept in police custody for about one week and that he had been subjected to ill-treatment during custody. He further denied the accusations against him. The judge ordered the applicant's release as there was no strong evidence demonstrating that he had committed the offences of which he was accused.

On 14 September 1999 the applicant filed a complaint with the Büyükçekmece public prosecutor's office against the police officers from the anti-terror branch of the Security Directorate, who had allegedly ill-treated him. In his petition, the applicant maintained that he had been arbitrarily deprived of his liberty between 5 and 8 September 1999 and that he had been subjected to ill-treatment while in police custody. He further contended that on the fourth or fifth day of his detention in police custody he had fainted due to ill-treatment and that he awoke in the Haseki State Hospital. He finally maintained that on 12 September 1999 the doctor had drawn up the medical report without examining him.

Upon receipt of the applicant's petition, on the same day the Büyükçekmece public prosecutor took a statement from the applicant who reiterated his complaints and requested that the police officers who had ill‑treated him be punished. The public prosecutor then requested the doctor at the Büyükçekmece Health Centre to examine the applicant and submit a medical report.

Still on the same day, the applicant was examined by a medical expert from the Büyükçekmece Health Centre, who observed two scarred incisions of 0.5 cm each on his nose and on his left heel, a scarred incision of 2-3 cm on his left elbow and an ecchymosis of 2 cm on his abdominal region.

On 15 September 1999 the applicant was examined by two medical experts from the Human Rights Foundation who noted the following marks and considered that the applicant's account of events was consistent with the marks observed on his body: “...a scabbed wound of 2 x 1 cm on the left elbow, a scabbed wound of 0.5 x 1 cm on the right side of the lower lip, an old wound of 0.5 cm in diameter on the forehead, a scabbed wound on the left heel, a dark brown ecchymosis of 3 x 1 cm on the left lower part of the sternum, haemorrhage on the upper part of the external part of the outer ear....”

On 20 September 1999 the Büyükçekmece public prosecutor issued a decision of lack of territorial jurisdiction and sent the investigation file to the Fatih public prosecutor's office.

On 23 and 26 November 1999 respectively the Fatih public prosecutor took statements from two police officers who were on duty at the anti-terror branch of the Istanbul Security Directorate at the time of the applicant's detention in police custody. The first officer R.D. contended that he had signed the document containing the applicant's statements but had not participated in the questioning. He denied the allegations against him. He further maintained that there had been no need to torture the applicant as the security forces had already found several organisational documents of the PKK in his house. The second officer, İ.K., denied the accusation and claimed that members of illegal organisations generally made this kind of false accusation. He further contended that the minor marks mentioned in the medical report of 14 September 1999 did not result from torture. He alleged that they might have been the marks resulting from handcuffing.

On 19 February 2001 the Fatih public prosecutor took a statement from the applicant, who reiterated his allegations and emphasised that he had been arrested on 5 September 1999, although the date on the arrest protocol was 8 September 1999.

On 20 February 2001 the Fatih public prosecutor issued a decision not to prosecute in respect of the police officers. He found that there was no evidence other than the applicant's allegations on which to initiate criminal proceedings against the police officers.

On 15 May 2001 the applicant filed an objection against the decision of 20 February 2001.

On 29 August 2001 the Beyoğlu Assize Court dismissed the applicant's objection. This decision was served on the applicant's lawyer on 9 October 2001.","{'applicant': 'Süleyman Erkan', 'articles': [91, 34, 51, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-84819
235,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 1249/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Yunus Atalay (“the applicant”), on 18 September 2002.

The applicant was represented by Mr Şeref Turgut, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

Invoking Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention, the applicant alleged that a number of police officers had subjected him to ill-treatment and that the national authorities had not only failed to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances of the ill-treatment, but had also failed to punish those responsible.

On 10 May 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3 of the Convention).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Istanbul.

At approximately 11 p.m. on 24 August 1995, a police car stopped outside the shop run by the applicant in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Three police officers got out of the car and asked the applicant to remove the letters “DHKP/C” (the abbreviation for the Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party/Front, an illegal organisation) written on a wall, two shops down the road from the applicant’s shop.

When the applicant refused to comply with that request and told the police officers that it was not his wall and therefore he had no obligation to clean it up, the police officers started to beat him. A number of other police officers, who were driving in the area at the time, also stopped and took part in the beating. The police officers then took the applicant into custody where they continued to beat him in order to force him to sign statements, confessing to the offence of obstructing the police in the course of their duty.

According to the incident report prepared by the three police officers who had beaten the applicant, the letters “DHKP/C” had been on the wall of the applicant’s shop and the applicant had told them that he would “rather die than wipe them away” and had then run away. When the police officers gave chase, the applicant had thrown stones at them and had kicked and punched them, injuring one of them in the process. Consequently, the officers had taken the applicant to the police station.

The following day the applicant was taken to the First Aid Hospital in Istanbul’s Taksim district where a medical report was prepared. According to this report, the applicant’s body bore a number of ecchymoses and lacerations.

The applicant was then brought to the office of the public prosecutor in Beyoğlu district where he told the prosecutor that the police officers had tortured him.

The same day the prosecutor referred the applicant to the Beyoğlu branch of the Forensic Medicine Institute where he was examined by a doctor. The following injuries are recorded in the medical report prepared at the end of that examination: a one centimetre long abrasion on the left side of the rear parietal region; a thirty centimetre long ecchymosed area stretching from the back of the left shoulder to the right scapular area; an ecchymosed area measuring fifteen by three centimetres below the left scapular region; an ecchymosed area, measuring fifteen by five centimetres, on the left lumbar; two ecchymosed areas, measuring seven by three and seven by fourteen centimetres, on the right side of the chest; four one centimetre long bleeding grazes and two ecchymosed areas, each measuring three centimetres in diameter, on the inside of the left arm; two ecchymosed areas, each measuring two centimetres, on the left cheek; and another ecchymosed area on the right tibial region. The report concluded that the applicant would be unable to work for a period of ten days.

The same day the prosecutor ordered the applicant’s release.

On 10 October 1995 the applicant lodged a formal complaint with the Beyoğlu prosecutor, seeking the prosecution of the three police officers responsible for the ill-treatment.

The following day the Beyoğlu prosecutor rendered a decision of non-jurisdiction, under the Law on the Trial of Civil Servants, and transferred the case file to the governor’s office in Beyoğlu for the “necessary action to be taken”.

On 21 July 1997 the Beyoğlu District Administrative Council, presided over by the Beyoğlu governor, granted authorisation for the prosecution of the three officers.

In its decision of 29 February 2000, the Beyoğlu Criminal Court of First Instance (hereinafter “the trial court”) convicted the three police officers of the offence of ill-treatment contrary to Article 245 of the Criminal Code, and sentenced each of them to three months’ imprisonment. The trial court also ordered their suspension from duty for a period of three months. Considering that the applicant’s “refusal to wipe away the writing on the wall and his attacks on the police officers” amounted to a “provocation”, within the meaning of Article 51 § 1 of the Criminal Code, the trial court reduced the prison sentences by a quarter and sentenced each officer to two months and seven days’ imprisonment. Taking into account the way in which the incident had taken place and the unlikelihood of police officers committing offences, the trial court was of the opinion that these particular officers would not reoffend if their sentences were suspended. Accordingly, it suspended their sentences under Article 6 of Law no. 647.

Two of the three police officers lodged appeals against the judgment. The judgment became final in so far as it concerned the third police officer, who did not appeal.

On 30 January 2002 the judgment was quashed by the Court of Cassation in so far as it concerned the two appellant police officers. The Court of Cassation held that the provisions of Law no. 4616 should be applied to them.

On 26 April 2002 the trial court suspended the proceedings against the two police officers in accordance with Law no. 4616, which had entered into force on 22 December 2000 and which provides for the suspension of criminal cases in respect of certain offences committed before 23 April 1999.

The applicant lodged an objection with the Beyoğlu Assize Court against the trial court’s decision, pointing out that the Court of Cassation had waited two years before rendering its judgment, and had only quashed the judgment following the entry into force of Law no. 4616. In any event, criminal proceedings concerning the offence of torture were outside the scope of that Law and could not, therefore, be suspended. Since, under Turkish law, ill-treatment could only be classified as torture if it was inflicted with the aim of extracting information from the victim (the offence defined in Article 243 of the Criminal Code), the trial court had no choice but to apply Article 245 of the Criminal Code in the present case. Nevertheless, the fact remained that the ill-treatment to which he had been subjected constituted “torture” within the meaning of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.

On 28 May 2002 the Beyoğlu Assize Court rejected the applicant’s objection.","{'applicant': 'Yunus Atalay', 'articles': [91, 34, 51, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-88377

The case originated in an application (no. 8917/05) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Atilla Kart (“the applicant”), on 8 February 2005.

The applicant was represented by Ms G. Egeli, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

The applicant complained in particular that the refusal to lift his parliamentary immunity had hindered criminal proceedings against him, thereby depriving him of his right of access to a court under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Ankara.

In the parliamentary elections of 3 November 2002, as a member of the People's Republican Party (CHP), he was elected MP for the Konya constituency to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (“the National Assembly”).

Prior to his election he practised as a lawyer in Konya and, in the course of his professional activities, two sets of criminal proceedings were brought against him, one for insulting a lawyer and the other for insulting a public official.

As an MP he enjoyed parliamentary immunity.

On 23 December 2002 the Karapınar public prosecutor applied to the General Directorate of the Ministry of Justice to have the applicant's parliamentary immunity lifted for the purposes of the criminal proceedings against him for insulting a lawyer.

On 17 January 2003 the General Directorate of the Ministry of Justice transmitted the request to the Prime Minister's Office.

On 11 April 2003 the Konya Assize Court (“the Assize Court”) adopted a decision suspending the criminal proceedings against the applicant for insulting a public official, by virtue of Article 83 of the Constitution (on parliamentary immunity) and Article 253 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

On 4 December 2003 the Assize Court transmitted the case file to the Ministry of Justice with a view to having the applicant's parliamentary immunity lifted.

On 23 December 2003 the Department of Criminal Affairs of the Ministry of Justice referred the question to the Prime Minister.

The Prime Minister's Office transmitted the case file to the National Assembly's joint committee (“the joint committee”).

On 28 May 2004, after noting that the applicant had requested the lifting of his immunity, the joint committee decided, in view of the nature of the charges, to stay the proceedings against him for insulting a public official until the end of his term of parliamentary office. It transmitted its decision to the plenary Assembly of the National Assembly (“the plenary Assembly”).

When the plenary Assembly met on 8 December 2004 the joint committee's report was read and appended to the minutes of the meeting.

On 15 December 2004 the applicant challenged the joint committee's decision. In his pleadings he made the point that parliamentary immunity had not been introduced to render Members of Parliament unaccountable or immune from punishment, but to allow them to discharge their duties wholly independently and dispassionately. Unlike non-liability, he argued, immunity was by nature a relative and temporary privilege. However, the scope of the immunity, the procedure for lifting it and the shortcomings in its implementation had undermined due respect for the National Assembly. The applicant added that it was unacceptable, in a society governed by the rule of law, that an institution originally meant to help MPs to discharge their duties should be transformed into a personal privilege.

On an unspecified date examination of the matter of the lifting of the applicant's parliamentary immunity in the proceedings concerning the insulting of a lawyer was referred to the joint committee under Rules 131 et seq. of the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly. The National Assembly decided to stay the proceedings until the dissolution of the 22nd Parliament.

On 31 January 2005 the applicant challenged that decision.

His file was then sent before the plenary Assembly.

On 7 February 2005 the Secretariat of the Speaker's Office informed the applicant that the files concerning him had been placed on the agenda of the plenary Assembly.

At the meeting of the plenary Assembly on 16 February 2005 the applicant once again asked to be allowed to avail himself of his right to be judged in a fair trial and requested that the obstacles to his exercise of that right be removed.

The applicant was re-elected as CHP party MP for the Konya constituency in the parliamentary elections of 22 July 2007.

On 8 January 2008 the Speaker of the National Assembly sent him a letter informing him of progress with the procedure for lifting his parliamentary immunity. The relevant passages read as follows: “(...) during the 22nd Parliament [2002-2007] 299 files concerning immunity were forwarded to the joint committee. In 252 cases the committee decided to stay the proceedings until the next dissolution. In 226 cases that decision was challenged. The files corresponding to those cases were placed on the plenary Assembly's agenda for examination. However, the plenary Assembly did not examine them. During the 22nd Parliament's term two files concerned your immunity. The first, file no. 3/176, concerned the proceedings brought against you by the Konya-Ereğli public prosecutor for insulting a lawyer; the second, file no. 3/453, concerned the proceedings before the Konya Assize Court for insulting a public official. In both cases the joint committee decided to stay the proceedings until the end of your term of office. Following your appeal, the files were placed on the plenary Assembly's agenda but have not been examined. In this 23rd Parliament [which started in 2007] 77 files concerning the lifting of immunity remain pending before the joint committee. Two of those files are in your name; they were given the numbers 3/107 and 3/129 following your re-election on 22 July 2007. Since the beginning of this Parliament all the files, including yours, have been sent before three preparatory committees set up by the joint committee. These committees started work on 27 December 2007 (...). They are to announce their decisions within a month of that date.”

On 23 and 24 January 2008 the applicant filed two defence memorials against the suspension of the two sets of criminal proceedings against him. In them he repeated his wish to be allowed to exercise his right to a fair trial.","{'applicant': 'Atilla Kart', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-87448
237,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 6093/04) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Władysław Jamroży (“the applicant”), on 3 February 2004.

The applicant was represented by Mr W. Kabański, a lawyer practising in Warsaw. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The applicant alleged, in particular, that his pre-trial detention had exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.

On 14 November 2007 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3). In addition, third-party comments were received from the Polish Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, Warsaw, which had been given leave by the President to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 2).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Polanica Zdrój.

A. Criminal proceedings against the applicant and his pre-trial detention

On 27 May 2002 the applicant was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (Centralne Biuro Śledcze) on suspicion of having committed fraud.

On 30 May 2002 the Warsaw District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded the applicant in custody in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. It further considered that there was a risk that he would induce the co-accused to give false testimony or obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings by destroying the documentary evidence relevant to the investigation; at the time of his arrest the applicant was found to be destroying documents which might be important for the further conduct of the proceedings. The court also stressed the likelihood that a heavy penalty would be imposed on him.

On 6 June 2002 the applicant appealed unsuccessfully against the detention order. In his further applications for release and appeals he maintained that, given his poor health, detention was putting a severe strain on him.

On 13 June 2002 the applicant lodged a motion with the State Prosecutor (Prokurator Krajowy) for the case to be referred to another prosecutor because the prosecutor dealing with his case was not in his view impartial. In his motion the applicant alleged that he had been denied access to his lawyer in breach of his right to defence. On 4 September 2002 the motion was dismissed by the State Prosecutor.

On 3 October 2002 the applicant lodged an application with the Warsaw Prosecutor of Appeal (Prokurator Apelacyjny) for the detention to be either lifted or replaced by another preventive measure. On 7 December 2002 the application was dismissed.

On 21 August 2002 the Warsaw District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 31 October 2002. It repeated the grounds originally given for his detention.

On 24 October 2002 the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy), on appeal by the applicant, upheld the decision of 21 August 2002. It repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant’s detention and referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on him.

Subsequently, further decisions extending the applicant’s detention were taken by the Warsaw District Court. The relevant decisions were taken on the following dates: 28 October 2002 (extending his detention until 31 December 2002), 30 December 2002 (extending his detention until 28 February 2003), 26 February 2003 (extending his detention until 30 April 2003) and 25 April 2003 (extending his detention until 26 May 2003).

On 23 May 2003 the Warsaw Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention until 21 June 2003. The court again relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence in question and on the severity of the expected penalty. It also mentioned that the continued detention was justified by reasons referred to in Article 263 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, without however specifying them.

The Warsaw District Court further extended the applicant’s detention on the following dates: 16 June 2003 (extending his detention until 20 September 2003), 19 September 2003 (extending his detention until 31 March 2004) and 27 February 2004 (extending his detention until 26 May 2004).

In the meantime, on 4 November 2002, the applicant had appealed against the decision of 28 October 2002 extending his pre-trial detention. No ruling was given on the appeal. On 27 February 2003 the Warsaw District Court gave a decision stating that a ruling on that appeal would be purposeless, as the impugned decision had expired on 31 December 2002.

On 16 December 2002 the applicant lodged an application with the Prosecutor of Appeal for his detention to be lifted and replaced by bail. The applicant referred to his health problems. On 2 January 2003, the Prosecutor of Appeal dismissed the application, emphasising that the documents submitted in support of the applicant’s request did not constitute sufficient evidence of the alleged negative effect of detention on his health. On 29 January 2003 the State Prosecutor dismissed an appeal by the applicant against the decision of 2 January 2003. On 19 April 2004 the applicant was subjected to a medical examination at his own request. The results of the medical examination did not reveal grounds for release.

On 9 June 2003 the applicant was served with a bill of indictment.

On 17 August 2004 the Warsaw District Court lifted the applicant’s detention and released him on bail. The court prohibited the applicant from leaving the country and confiscated his passport.

On 27 October 2005 the applicant asked for the prohibition on leaving the country to be lifted. On 28 October 2005 the Warsaw District Court dismissed his application.

The applicant appealed. On 30 November 2005 the Warsaw District Court dismissed the appeal.

The applicant’s further numerous requests for the prohibition on leaving the country to be lifted were unsuccessful. On 22 June 2007 the Warsaw District Court again refused the applicant’s request. The applicant’s lawyer appealed.

On 10 October 2007 the Warsaw District Court granted the appeal and lifted the preventive measure in question. The court found that the applicant had not obstructed the proceedings, had not tried to escape and had been always at the disposal of the domestic authorities.

The case is pending before the first-instance court.

B. Complaint concerning the length of proceedings

On 18 January 2006 the applicant lodged, under the Law of 17 June 2004 (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”), a complaint concerning the length of the examination of his appeal against the decision of 28 October 2002 prolonging his pre-trial detention. He stressed that he had appealed on 4 November 2002. He claimed compensation in the amount of 10,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) (approx. EUR 2,500). The Warsaw District Court refused to entertain the appeal on 27 February 2003.

On 28 February 2006 the Warsaw Court of Appeal declined to consider the complaint. It referred to the fact that the complaint concerned proceedings prior to the entry into force of the 2004 Act and that the 2004 Act produced legal effects as from the date of its entry into force.","{'applicant': 'Władysław Jamroży', 'articles': [91, 34, 52, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 53, 34, 93], 'countries': 'POL', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2009}",001-93953

The case originated in an application (no. 61392/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Joseph Fallon (“the applicant”) on 5 September 2000.

The applicant was represented before the Court by Pierce Glynn Solicitors, London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant complained under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that, because he was a man, he was denied social security benefits equivalent to those received by widows.

By a partial decision of 10 October 2001 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning widows' benefits and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible. By a decision of 8 April 2003 the Court declared the complaint regarding Widowed Mother's Allowance admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Dorset.

His wife died on 13 July 1999, leaving four children born in 1981, 1983, 1991 and 1999. His claim for widows' benefits was made in May 2000 and was rejected on 16 May 2000 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows' benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.","{'applicant': 'Joseph Fallon', 'articles': [91, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2007}",001-83337

The case originated in an application (no. 61392/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Joseph Fallon (“the applicant”) on 5 September 2000.

The applicant was represented before the Court by Pierce Glynn Solicitors, London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant complained under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that, because he was a man, he was denied social security benefits equivalent to those received by widows.

By a partial decision of 10 October 2001 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning widows' benefits and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible. By a decision of 8 April 2003 the Court declared the complaint regarding Widowed Mother's Allowance admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible.

The case originated in an application (no. 22302/10) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Swedish national, Mr Raja Arlewin (“the applicant”), on 18 March 2010.

The applicant was represented by Mr K. Lewis and Mr J. Södergren, lawyers practising in Stockholm. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr A. Rönquist, Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

The applicant alleged, in particular, that he had been deprived of effective access to court and that the State had failed to provide him with sufficient protection against allegations that violated his right to privacy.

On 5 March 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Stockholm. He is self-employed and runs a business.

On 22 April 2004 the Swedish commercial television channel TV3 broadcast an episode of a television show entitled “Insider”, in which it was claimed that “shady transactions and shady characters” were revealed. The show was broadcast live with a few recorded features. In the show, the applicant, who was unknown to the broader public, appeared in pictures and was mentioned by name. He was singled out as the central figure of organised crime within media and advertising and as being guilty of several counts of fraud and other economic offences. The programme was re‑broadcast on 25 April and 17 September 2004. At this time, no criminal investigation had been initiated against the applicant.

The television programme was produced in Sweden by the Swedish company Strix Television AB. It was sent by satellite link from Sweden to the London-based company Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd and from there sent unaltered to a satellite which transmitted the programme to the Swedish audience. The encoded programme was viewable via a satellite receiver or a cable connection in Sweden a fraction of a second after it had been sent by satellite link. Even if it was viewable in the United Kingdom, which is doubtful, it would have been watched there by a small audience. It was presented in the Swedish language for a Swedish-speaking audience, and was sponsored by companies competing in the Swedish market. The anchorman of the show, X, a Swedish national, was a celebrity and a well-known television personality in Sweden; he was also the Chief Executive Officer of Strix Television AB. The show had a long run and was watched by many viewers.

In October 2006 the applicant brought a private prosecution against X for gross defamation, claiming damages in the amount of 250,000 Swedish kronor (SEK; approximately 27,000 euros). He maintained that he had been unreservedly pointed out as the central figure of organised crime within media and advertising and as being directly or indirectly responsible for a large number of serious crimes. He further alleged that X was responsible for the content of the programme since he had failed in his duty to appoint a legally responsible editor (ansvarig utgivare) for the programme and because he had been its anchor.

The applicant relied on Chapters 5 and 6 of the Constitutional Law on Freedom of Expression (Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen, 1991:1469; hereafter “the Constitutional Law”), regarding freedom of expression offences and liability rules, and Chapter 5 of the Penal Code (Brottsbalken), dealing with defamation, as well as Articles 6 § 2, 8 and 13 of the Convention. In the latter respect, he argued that his appearance in the show breached his right to privacy as well as his right to be presumed innocent and that a decision to dismiss his claims would constitute a violation of his right to an effective remedy. The applicant submitted a legal opinion stating that it would be impossible, or at least not useful, to bring an action in the United Kingdom in the present case since the damage flowing from the television programme at issue had not occurred in the United Kingdom.

X disputed the claim on the grounds, inter alia, that he was not the responsible editor of the show and that he enjoyed the freedom to communicate information as provided for under Chapter 10, section 2 of the Constitutional Law and as clarified by the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen) in the case NJA 2005 p. 884 (see paragraphs 32 and 33 below).

In a preliminary ruling on 20 May 2008 the Stockholm District Court (Stockholms tingsrätt) dismissed the claim in so far as it was based on the Constitutional Law. It referred to the Supreme Court judgment in an almost identical case, NJA 2002 p. 314 (see paragraphs 28-31 below), and held that Chapters 1-9 of the Constitutional Law were not applicable to the television programme since it could not be regarded as emanating from Sweden. This was because the programme had first been sent by satellite link to Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd, the British company responsible for the programme content, and thereafter uplinked to a satellite, which had in turn transmitted the programme to viewers in Sweden. As Chapters 1-9 of the Constitutional Law were not applicable, X could not be held responsible for the programme content under Chapter 6. The District Court further held that the applicant’s claims under the Penal Code were to be determined following the main hearing in the case. The court finally drew the parties’ attention to the Supreme Court case NJA 2005 p. 884.

The applicant appealed, repeating what he had stated in his earlier submissions. He further argued that all companies involved in the case were Swedish, including the receiving company in London, allegedly named Viasat AB, with its seat in Stockholm. Although Viasat AB had acquired the right to transmit the show from the Swedish company TV3 AB, it had had no impact on or responsibility for the programme selection. Having regard to the above, the offence committed against the applicant through the programme could not be examined by United Kingdom courts. The applicant also submitted that Swedish courts were competent to examine the case under the Brussels I Regulation (see further paragraph 35 below). X contested the arguments and submitted that it was the company Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd, whose seat was in the United Kingdom, which was responsible for the programme service and decided on the final content of the programmes.

On 20 March 2009 the Court of Appeal (Svea hovrätt) upheld the District Court’s decision. It held that the issue for it to determine was whether the general provisions in the Constitutional Law were applicable to the programme in question, that is, whether or not the broadcasting of the programme could be considered to have originated from Sweden within the meaning of Chapter 1, section 6(2) of that law. It further stated that the burden of proof concerning the applicability of the Constitutional Law rested on the applicant and that he had not, in response to X’s refutation, established that the decisions concerning the programme content were taken in Sweden. Consequently, Chapters 1-9 of the Constitutional Law were not applicable in the case. The court further held that the material before it indicated that it was possible for the applicant to bring claims before a British court.

The applicant appealed and referred to his earlier submissions. In addition, he requested that a question concerning the interpretation of the Brussels I Regulation be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) for a preliminary ruling. According to the applicant, the regulation entitled a person claiming non-contractual damages to bring actions where the harmful event occurred. In the present case, the harmful event had occurred in Sweden and the applicant thus should have had the right to bring his action before the Swedish courts. Consequently, the position hitherto taken by the Swedish courts ran contrary to Community law.

On 21 September 2009 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s referral request and refused leave to appeal in the case. It held that, since the District Court had found itself competent to examine the applicant’s claims in so far as they were based on grounds other than the Constitutional Law, there was no reason to request a preliminary ruling from the ECJ.

The applicant subsequently withdrew his remaining claims before the District Court since there was no practical prospect of success in a continued procedure. On 17 November 2009 the District Court struck the case out of the list and ordered the applicant to pay X’s legal costs and expenses.

Criminal proceedings were taken against the applicant in regard, inter alia, to the matters described in the television programme. He was convicted of aggravated fraud as well as tax and bookkeeping offences and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The criminal proceedings were finalised by a Supreme Court decision to refuse leave to appeal on 4 October 2010. These proceedings, in particular their compliance with Articles 6 and 7 of the Convention, are the subject of an application lodged with the Court on 4 April 2011 (no. 32814/11).","{'applicant': 'Raja Arlewin', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 51, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2016}",001-160998

The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Liverpool.

His wife died on 3 February 2001 leaving dependent children. His claim for widows’ benefits under the new scheme was made on 30 April 2001 and was rejected on 9 May 2001 on the ground that his wife died before 9 April 2001. The applicant applied for reconsideration and on 30 May 2001 he was informed that the decision remained unchanged. This decision was confirmed by an appeal tribunal on 20 October 2001. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.

After asking for reconsideration, the decision was again confirmed on 13 June 2000. The applicant appealed to the Social Security Tribunal which on 2 October 2000 confirmed the previous decision. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.

On 1 November 2000 the applicant applied to the Inland Revenue, requesting an allowance equivalent to that received by a widow, namely Widow’s Bereavement Allowance (“WBA”) for the years 1997/8 and 1998/9. On 14 November 2000 the Inland Revenue informed him that he was ineligible for WBA as he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.","{'applicant': 'Grattan Bond', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-85665

The case originated in an application (no. 63479/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Grattan Bond (“the applicant”) on 2 November 2000.

The applicant was represented before the Court by Pierce Glynn Solicitors, London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities’ refusal to grant him widows’ social security and tax benefits or equivalent constituted discrimination on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

By a decision of 8 October 2002 the Court decided to communicate the complaint in connection with his claim for widows’ benefits, relating to discrimination suffered by him during the period after the date on which he lodged his “second” claim for widows’ benefits and his claim for Bereavement Tax Allowance. It declared the remainder of the application inadmissible. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it subsequently decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

270,"PROCEDURE

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 2 December 1995, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). It originated in an application (no. 22299/93) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by Mr David Gregory, a British citizen, on 7 July 1993. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 6 and 14 of the Convention (art. 6, art. 14).

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).

The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 4 (b)). On 8 February 1996, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr F. Matscher, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr N. Valticos, Mr I. Foighel and Mr A.B. Baka (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43). Subsequently, Mr Bernhardt and Mr Macdonald were prevented from taking part in the consideration of the case and were replaced respectively by Mr Ryssdal as President of the Chamber and by Mr A. Spielmann, first substitute judge.

As President of the Chamber at that time (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the United Kingdom Government (“the Government“), the applicant’s representative and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 28 June 1996 and the Government’s memorial on 2 July 1996. Following enquiries conducted through the Registrar no objection was raised as to making accessible the applicant’s submissions in the proceedings before the Commission, dated 24 June 1994 and 10 March 1995. These submissions were subsequently appended to the applicant’s memorial.

On 13 June 1996 the President of the Chamber at the time, Mr Bernhardt, granted leave to Rights International, a non-governmental human rights organisation based in New York, to submit written comments (Rule 37 para. 2). These were received on 28 August 1996 and forwarded on 3 September 1996 to the Delegate of the Commission, the applicant’s representative and the Agent of the Government for comment. No comments were received.

In accordance with a decision of the then President of the Chamber, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 21 October 1996. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Ms S. Dickson, Agent, Mr N. Garnham, Counsel, Mr S. Bramley, Mrs B. Moxon, Advisers; (b) for the Commission Mr G. Ress, Delegate; (c) for the applicant Mr M. Mansfield QC, Mr P. Herbert, Counsel, Mr E. Abrahamson, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr Ress, Mr Mansfield and Mr Garnham.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. Particular circumstances of the case

The applicant, who is black, is a British citizen born in 1966 and currently living in Manchester, England.

A. The trial

The applicant was tried for robbery at Manchester Crown Court between 26 and 28 November 1991. He was legally represented at the trial.

On the final day of the trial, at 10.46 a.m., the jury retired to consider their verdict. An hour and three quarters later a note was passed by the jury to the judge. It read: “JURY SHOWING RACIAL OVERTONES. 1 MEMBER TO BE EXCUSED.“

In the absence of the jury, the trial judge showed the note to counsel for the prosecution and defence and consulted them on the appropriate response to it.

There is some uncertainty as to the stance taken by defence counsel with regard to the follow-up to be given to the note. Prosecution counsel recalls that defence counsel did not raise strong objections to the approach which the judge indicated he intended to pursue, namely to recall the jury and give clear directions on their duty to return a verdict on the basis of the evidence alone. However, defence counsel seems to recall that he did in fact ask the trial judge to discharge the jury in the circumstances, but his application was refused. Defence counsel based his recollection on the grounds of appeal and advice on appeal which he drafted shortly after the trial on 10 December 1991. However, neither of these documents suggests that defence counsel made an express request to the judge to discharge the jury. Under point 4 of his grounds of appeal, defence counsel concluded: “It is submitted that, in the circumstances aforesaid, some enquiries should have taken place with a view to acceding to the request of the jury that one of their numbers be discharged.“ In the accompanying advice on appeal, defence counsel stated: “It seems to me that it is at least arguable that the trial judge should have enquired further into the matter with a view to acceding to the request that the jury were making.“

The judge’s recollection is that both counsel agreed to his proposed course of action (see paragraph 11 above).

The jury were recalled at 12.47 p.m. Pausing at appropriate junctures to ensure that his statement was being understood, the judge redirected the jury in the following terms: “You are brought here as twelve people from your various walks of life, your various backgrounds. Everybody has preconceived ideas and thoughts but you are brought here from twelve different backgrounds expecting to apply your twelve different minds to the problems that are put before you ... you decide this case according to the evidence and nothing else in the case. Any thoughts or prejudice of one form or another, for or against anybody, must be put out of your minds. You decide this case on evidence. It is the evidence alone which decides the case. Do you understand that, members of the jury? You are the judges and you decide it on the evidence, and weighing the individuals as you saw them and allowing no other factor to influence your decision, but your decision about the quality of the evidence and the way in which a particular individual you are considering, treating them all alike and making no distinction whether a person is a defendant or otherwise, where he lives, where he comes from. Do you understand that? I am certainly not going to discharge any member of the jury because he or she may wish [me] to do so because they dislike certain overtones in the conversation. Decide this case according to the evidence. Members of the jury, I am not saying you should be biased in favour or against it. Look at the way it was given. Decide the case that way and no other. That is your sworn duty. I expect you to abide by your sworn duty.“

The jury then retired at 12.50 p.m. At 2.21 p.m. the jury, being unable to reach a unanimous verdict, were recalled by the judge. He informed them that the time had come when he could accept a verdict of at least a majority of ten. The jury retired again at 2.24 p.m. At 3.27 p.m. the jury were still undecided and they were called back again. The judge further directed the jury as follows: “Members of the jury, each of you has taken an oath to reach a true verdict according to the evidence. Remember that is the oath you took two days ago. Not one of you must be false to that oath. You do have a duty, not only as individuals but collectively as a jury. That, of course, is the strength of the jury system. So each of you when you go into your jury room take with you your individual experience and wisdom ... Your task is to pool that experience and wisdom. You must do that by giving your views and listening to the views of other people. Of necessity there will be discussion ... There has got to be argument and there has got to be give and take within the scope of the oath that each of you has taken. That is the way you achieve agreement.“

At 4.06 p.m. the jury returned and delivered a ten to two majority verdict finding the applicant guilty. The applicant was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment.

B. The appeal proceedings

The applicant sought leave from the Court of Appeal to appeal against conviction. He submitted that in the circumstances the trial judge had wrongly failed to make any enquiry into the note with a view to determining whether one of the members of the jury should be discharged on the grounds of racial prejudice and that this failure gave rise to a material irregularity at the trial (see paragraph 11 above). Leave to appeal was refused by the single judge on 28 February 1992. He stated that: “The learned judge dealt with the novel and delicate situation presented by the jury note with tact and sensitivity. It would have been entirely inappropriate for him to have conducted some sort of enquiry. There was no material irregularity at your trial.“

The applicant renewed his application to the full Court of Appeal. On 19 January 1993 the application was dismissed. The Court of Appeal noted that the trial judge “... took the view and this Court agrees with it, that the nature of the jury’s anxiety was that one member of the jury felt that there was a general overtone of racial comment which was unacceptable and not, as the applicant is suggesting, one member of the jury being so racially prejudiced as to be unable to give proper consideration to the matters before him“. The court continued: “Matters of this kind raise delicate issues. The jury system does require an element of give and take after proper directions from the judge. In our judgment His Honour Judge Hammond dealt with this matter sensitively, sensibly and correctly, and cannot be faulted for a conclusion that the jury should continue the deliberations which they had given their oath to undertake. We, therefore, find no ground for complaint and we dismiss this application.“","{'applicant': 'David Gregory', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1997}",001-58018

The applicant renewed his application to the full Court of Appeal. On 19 January 1993 the application was dismissed. The Court of Appeal noted that the trial judge “... took the view and this Court agrees with it, that the nature of the jury’s anxiety was that one member of the jury felt that there was a general overtone of racial comment which was unacceptable and not, as the applicant is suggesting, one member of the jury being so racially prejudiced as to be unable to give proper consideration to the matters before him“. The court continued: “Matters of this kind raise delicate issues. The jury system does require an element of give and take after proper directions from the judge. In our judgment His Honour Judge Hammond dealt with this matter sensitively, sensibly and correctly, and cannot be faulted for a conclusion that the jury should continue the deliberations which they had given their oath to undertake. We, therefore, find no ground for complaint and we dismiss this application.“","{'applicant': 'David Gregory', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1997}",001-58018

The case originated in an application (no. 64729/01) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr James Smith (“the applicant”), on 13 November 2000.

The applicant was unrepresented before the Court. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities’ refusal to grant him Widow’s Bereavement Allowance or equivalent constituted discrimination on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

By a partial decision of 4 December 2001 a Chamber of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate this application. Subsequently, under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1930 and lives in Scotland.

His wife died on 24 April 1994. On 26 October 2000 the applicant made a claim to the Inland Revenue requesting an allowance equivalent to that received by a widow, namely Widow’s Bereavement Allowance (“WBA”), for previous tax years. On 29 September 2000 the Inland Revenue informed him that he was ineligible for WBA as he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such benefit was payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.","{'applicant': 'James Smith', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-86341

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in London.

His wife died on 12 September 1999 leaving two children, born in 1995 and 1998.

On 30 March 2000 the applicant applied for benefits equivalent to those to which a widow, whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of his wife, would have been entitled, namely a Widow’s Payment a Widowed Mother’s Allowance and thereafter a Widow’s Pension, payable under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”). On 16 May 2000 the Benefits Agency refused his application because he was not a woman. He was told that he had no right of appeal since his claim had not been considered by a decision-maker.

On 5 October 2000 the applicant made a claim for Widow’s Bereavement Tax Allowance to the Inland Revenue for the year 1999-2000. On 12 October 2000 he was informed that his claim could not be accepted because there was no basis in domestic law allowing widowers to claim this benefit.

The applicant receives child benefit in the sum of GBP 100 every four weeks.","{'applicant': 'Nicholas P. Jackson', 'articles': [91, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-87515

The case originated in an application (no. 62776/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Richard Cross (“the applicant”) on 9 October 2000.

The applicant was unrepresented before this Court. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities' refusal to grant him Widowed Bereavement Allowance or equivalent constituted discrimination on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Ms A. Bromley, a lawyer practising in Nottingham. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Grainger of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant alleged that he had not been afforded a proper review of the lawfulness of his continued detention as a mandatory life prisoner and that he did not enjoy an enforceable right to compensation for any breaches of his right to liberty.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, born in 1939, is currently detained in HM Prison Full Sutton.

In 1964, the applicant was convicted of the murder of a woman whom he had violently assaulted. He was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment. In May 1980 (or November 1979, according to the applicant's submissions), he was released on life licence after a positive recommendation from the Parole Board.

In June 1981, the applicant killed a 75 year old woman. His plea of manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility was accepted by the court. In January 1982 a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment was imposed by the judge having regard to the extreme danger to the public posed by the applicant. At the same time, the court revoked his life licence concerning his earlier sentence of mandatory life imprisonment.

In December 1985, the applicant was transferred to the hospital wing of Parkhurst prison. Since then, he has been transferred into ordinary prison locations as a “Category A” (high security) prisoner.

The applicant learned that his “tariff” period fixed by the trial judge on the manslaughter offence expired in June 1991. He was informed by a Home Office Memorandum of 5 June 1992 that his continued detention was based on the risk he represented.

According to the applicant's submissions, his only Parole Board review took place in 1999, when, without holding an oral hearing, the Board declined to recommend release. According to the Government's submissions, the Parole Board considered the applicant's case in September 1994 and January 1997. In 1994, it concluded that his behaviour was aggressive and intimidatory and that he represented a high risk to the public. On 10 January 1997, it concluded that he remained far too great a risk to warrant transfer to open conditions. Of the reports before the Parole Board, none recommended early release or early transfer to open conditions.","{'applicant': 'Edward Wynne', 'articles': [91, 34, 53, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2003}",001-61376

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Ms A. Bromley, a lawyer practising in Nottingham. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Grainger of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant alleged that he had not been afforded a proper review of the lawfulness of his continued detention as a mandatory life prisoner and that he did not enjoy an enforceable right to compensation for any breaches of his right to liberty.

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

By a decision of 22 May 2003, the Court declared the application partly admissible.

Neither party filed further observations. The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, born in 1939, is currently detained in HM Prison Full Sutton.

In 1964, the applicant was convicted of the murder of a woman whom he had violently assaulted. He was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment. In May 1980 (or November 1979, according to the applicant's submissions), he was released on life licence after a positive recommendation from the Parole Board.

In June 1981, the applicant killed a 75 year old woman. His plea of manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility was accepted by the court. In January 1982 a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment was imposed by the judge having regard to the extreme danger to the public posed by the applicant. At the same time, the court revoked his life licence concerning his earlier sentence of mandatory life imprisonment.

In December 1985, the applicant was transferred to the hospital wing of Parkhurst prison. Since then, he has been transferred into ordinary prison locations as a “Category A” (high security) prisoner.

The applicant learned that his “tariff” period fixed by the trial judge on the manslaughter offence expired in June 1991. He was informed by a Home Office Memorandum of 5 June 1992 that his continued detention was based on the risk he represented.

According to the applicant's submissions, his only Parole Board review took place in 1999, when, without holding an oral hearing, the Board declined to recommend release. According to the Government's submissions, the Parole Board considered the applicant's case in September 1994 and January 1997. In 1994, it concluded that his behaviour was aggressive and intimidatory and that he represented a high risk to the public. On 10 January 1997, it concluded that he remained far too great a risk to warrant transfer to open conditions. Of the reports before the Parole Board, none recommended early release or early transfer to open conditions.","{'applicant': 'Edward Wynne', 'articles': [91, 34, 53, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2003}",001-61376

The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Cambridgeshire.

His wife died on 6 May 1997 leaving four children, the last born in 1987.

On 25 June 2000 the applicant applied for benefits equivalent to those to which a widow, whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of his wife, would have been entitled, namely a Widow’s Payment and Widowed Mother’s Allowance, payable under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”). He was informed on 29 June 2000 that the Benefits Agency was unable to accept his application as a valid claim because there was at that time no legislation providing an equivalent of the widows’ benefits concerned to widowers. He was told that he had no right of appeal since his claim had not been considered by a decision maker.

On 1 October 2000 the applicant made a claim for Widow’s Bereavement Tax Allowance to the Inland Revenue for the years 1997‑1999. On 20 October 2000 he was informed that his claim could not be accepted because there was no basis in domestic law allowing widowers to claim this benefit.

The applicant received child benefit in the sum of GBP 150.20 per month.","{'applicant': 'Nicholas Wells', 'articles': [91, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-87426

On 1 October 2000 the applicant made a claim for Widow’s Bereavement Tax Allowance to the Inland Revenue for the years 1997‑1999. On 20 October 2000 he was informed that his claim could not be accepted because there was no basis in domestic law allowing widowers to claim this benefit.

The case originated in an application (no. 17906/15) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Krzysztof Ruminski (“the applicant”), on 10 April 2015. He was represented before the Court by Ms A. Massarsch and later by Mr I. Vita, both lawyers practising in Stockholm.

The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms C. Hellner Kirstein, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

The applicant complained under Article 6 of the Convention that the Court of Appeal did not give adequate reasons for its judgment.

Mrs Helena Jäderblom, the judge elected in respect of Sweden, withdrew from the case (Rule 28). Accordingly, Mr Iain Thorburn Cameron was appointed to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 26 § 4 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).

On 25 August 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.

THE FACTS

A. The circumstances of the case

The applicant is a Swedish national born in 1950. He lives in Jordbro.

The applicant suffered for many years from, inter alia, pain in his back and legs and numbness in his right arm. He alternated between full and part-time sick leave from 1996 to 2001. In 1999 he received a partial early retirement pension and in 2002 a full disability pension.

In 2003 he applied for life annuity and alleged that his physical problems had been caused by his former employment as a driver (1973 to 1974), as a dairy worker (1974 to 1984) and as a food science technician (1984 to 1991). The Social Insurance Office (Försäkringskassan) appointed an in-house specialist in orthopaedic surgery who, in a written statement, concluded that there was not a high degree of probability (hög grad av sannolikhet) that any harmful element in the applicant’s former employment had caused his problems.

On 17 May 2005, after having held an oral hearing, the Social Insurance Office rejected the application. Referring to, inter alia, the specialist statement by the insurance doctor, it was held that the applicant had not been subject to any harmful influences which, with a high degree of probability, could have caused or aggravated his problems.

The applicant appealed to the County Administrative Court (förvaltningsrätten) of Stockholm. On 19 April 2007 the court, after having held an oral hearing, upheld the Social Insurance Office’s decision in full. The court found that, although it was scientifically known that employees in the food industry had a statistically high risk of injury, the circumstances in the applicant’s case had to be taken into account. The applicant’s back problems had appeared after barely two years in the industry and he suffered from degenerative changes to his back. Against that background, the medical investigation and other material did not adequately support the conclusion that the applicant, in his work, had been subject to any harmful influences which, with a high degree of probability, could have caused or aggravated his problems.

Upon further appeal to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten) of Stockholm, the applicant submitted, inter alia, a medical statement (epikris) issued in February 2008 by the Centre of Public Health, Occupational and Environmental Medicine (Centrum for folkhälsa, arbets‑ och miljömedicin). According to the medical statement, there were reasons to believe that the applicant’s work had caused his problems.

In a written statement to the appellate court, the Social Insurance Office questioned the conclusions in the medical statement as they were based on information about exposure which was to a high degree uncertain. Furthermore, there were medical records from 1997 in which the applicant was held to be fully able-bodied and in which it was noted that no somatic evidence had been found in support of the applicant’s symptoms.

On 17 March 2008, the Administrative Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal. The applicant requested an oral hearing in the case but, on 5 September 2008, the court rejected the request. It referred to the nature of the case and to the fact that an oral hearing had been held before the County Administrative Court. The applicant was given the opportunity to submit further observations.

In a judgment of 27 October 2008, the Administrative Court of Appeal upheld the lower court’s judgment in full. It first gave an account of the parties’ submissions and the evidence relied upon, including the medical statement of February 2008, and then stated the following reasons: “The medical and other evidence in the case does not demonstrate that the applicant has been exposed to any such harmful influences in his work which could, with a high degree of probability, have caused his problems. His back-related and other problems can thus – as has been found also by the County Administrative Court and the Social Insurance Office – not be defined as a work-related injury. [The applicant] is therefore not entitled to life annuity according to the [Work Injury Insurance Act]. The appeal must consequently be rejected.”

The applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen). He complained of the lack of reasoning in the Administrative Court of Appeal’s judgment and argued that that court’s refusal to hold an oral hearing had infringed his right to a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention.

On 4 August 2009, the Supreme Administrative Court refused leave to appeal.

On 3 February 2010 the applicant lodged an application with the Court, complaining that his right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention had been infringed because the Administrative Court of Appeal had refused to hold an oral hearing and its judgment had not been sufficiently reasoned.

This application was declared inadmissible by the Court on 21 May 2013 for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Court found that the applicant had failed to lodge a claim with the Chancellor of Justice (Justitiekanslern) or the ordinary courts to seek compensation for the alleged breaches of the Convention (Ruminski v. Sweden (dec.), no. 10404/10, 21 May 2013).

Consequently, on 30 December 2013, the applicant lodged a claim for compensation for the alleged breaches of the Convention with the Chancellor of Justice. He argued that the Administrative Court of Appeal’s lack of reasoning, as well as its refusal to hold an oral hearing, had infringed his right to a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. He requested 50,000 Swedish kronor (SEK) for non-pecuniary damage.

The Chancellor of Justice communicated the case to the Administrative Court of Appeal which submitted that its handling of the case had been in accordance with domestic law as well as the Convention. In response, the applicant maintained, and developed the grounds for, his claim.

On 15 January 2015 the Chancellor of Justice rejected the applicant’s claim. As concerns the lack of an oral hearing, the Chancellor of Justice noted that the Social Insurance Office and the County Administrative Court had held an oral hearing and consequently, in accordance with the Court’s case-law, a less strict standard applied to the requirement to hold a hearing before the appellate court. Thus, in view of the character of the case and the fact that the applicant had been given the opportunity to finalise his submissions in writing and the court had had access to substantial written evidence, the Chancellor of Justice concluded that there had been no breach of the Convention in this respect.

As concerns the Administrative Court of Appeal’s alleged lack of reasoning, the Chancellor of Justice referred extensively to the Court’s case law on this matter and then made the following evaluation. The Administrative Court of Appeal had, in its judgment, accounted for the applicant’s arguments and the new evidence he had submitted before it. It had further accounted for the considerations and conclusions drawn from the evidence submitted by the parties, namely, that the investigation in the case did not demonstrate that the applicant had been exposed to any such harmful influences in his work which, with a high degree of probability, could have caused his problems. Thus, the Chancellor of Justice found that the Administrative Court of Appeal had taken a stance on the central and decisive question in the case, that is, whether the applicant had been exposed to harmful influences in his work. While the Chancellor noted that it would have been preferable, for pedagogical reasons, for the court to have given clearer grounds for why the applicant’s evidence had not been sufficient, she concluded that the reasoning was not so deficient that the applicant’s right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention had been infringed.

B. Relevant domestic law and practice

At the relevant time, provisions on work injuries were set out in the Work Injury Insurance Act (Lag (1976:380) om arbetsskadeförsäkring), which covered all people working in Sweden. A person whose ability to earn an income had been impaired due to a work-related injury was in some specified situations eligible for life annuity (Chapter 4, section 1). The term “work-related injury” referred to injuries resulting from accidents or other harmful effects at work. “Other harmful effect” meant the influence of a factor that with a high degree of probability might cause the kind of injury suffered (Chapter 2, section 1(1)). If an insured person had suffered an accident or another harmful effect, the injury was to be considered to have been caused by the harmful effect, if that causal link was highly probable (Chapter 2, section 2). The standard of proof was somewhat mitigated on 1 July 2002, but that amendment did not apply to the applicant’s case.

The administration of justice before the administrative courts is regulated by the Administrative Court Procedure Act (Förvaltningsprocesslagen, 1971:291). According to section 30 of the Act, the determination of a case by a court must be based on what is contained in the documents and what has otherwise been established in the case. The decision must state the reasons that determined the outcome.","{'applicant': 'Krzysztof Ruminski', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2017}",001-173265

The case originated in an application (no. 17906/15) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Krzysztof Ruminski (“the applicant”), on 10 April 2015.

The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms C. Hellner Kirstein, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

The applicant complained under Article 6 of the Convention that the Court of Appeal did not give adequate reasons for its judgment.

Mrs Helena Jäderblom, the judge elected in respect of Sweden, withdrew from the case (Rule 28). Accordingly, Mr Iain Thorburn Cameron was appointed to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 26 § 4 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).

On 25 August 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.

Against that background, the medical investigation and other material did not adequately support the conclusion that the applicant, in his work, had been subject to any harmful influences which, with a high degree of probability, could have caused or aggravated his problems.

Upon further appeal to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten) of Stockholm, the applicant submitted, inter alia, a medical statement (epikris) issued in February 2008 by the Centre of Public Health, Occupational and Environmental Medicine (Centrum for folkhälsa, arbets‑ och miljömedicin). According to the medical statement, there were reasons to believe that the applicant’s work had caused his problems.

In a written statement to the appellate court, the Social Insurance Office questioned the conclusions in the medical statement as they were based on information about exposure which was to a high degree uncertain. Furthermore, there were medical records from 1997 in which the applicant was held to be fully able-bodied and in which it was noted that no somatic evidence had been found in support of the applicant’s symptoms.

On 17 March 2008, the Administrative Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal. The applicant requested an oral hearing in the case but, on 5 September 2008, the court rejected the request. It referred to the nature of the case and to the fact that an oral hearing had been held before the County Administrative Court. The applicant was given the opportunity to submit further observations.

In a judgment of 27 October 2008, the Administrative Court of Appeal upheld the lower court’s judgment in full. It first gave an account of the parties’ submissions and the evidence relied upon, including the medical statement of February 2008, and then stated the following reasons: “The medical and other evidence in the case does not demonstrate that the applicant has been exposed to any such harmful influences in his work which could, with a high degree of probability, have caused his problems. His back-related and other problems can thus – as has been found also by the County Administrative Court and the Social Insurance Office – not be defined as a work-related injury. [The applicant] is therefore not entitled to life annuity according to the [Work Injury Insurance Act]. The appeal must consequently be rejected.”

The applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen). He complained of the lack of reasoning in the Administrative Court of Appeal’s judgment and argued that that court’s refusal to hold an oral hearing had infringed his right to a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention.

On 4 August 2009, the Supreme Administrative Court refused leave to appeal.

On 3 February 2010 the applicant lodged an application with the Court, complaining that his right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention had been infringed because the Administrative Court of Appeal had refused to hold an oral hearing and its judgment had not been sufficiently reasoned.

This application was declared inadmissible by the Court on 21 May 2013 for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Court found that the applicant had failed to lodge a claim with the Chancellor of Justice (Justitiekanslern) or the ordinary courts to seek compensation for the alleged breaches of the Convention (Ruminski v. Sweden (dec.), no. 10404/10, 21 May 2013).

Consequently, on 30 December 2013, the applicant lodged a claim for compensation for the alleged breaches of the Convention with the Chancellor of Justice. He argued that the Administrative Court of Appeal’s lack of reasoning, as well as its refusal to hold an oral hearing, had infringed his right to a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. He requested 50,000 Swedish kronor (SEK) for non-pecuniary damage.

The Chancellor of Justice communicated the case to the Administrative Court of Appeal which submitted that its handling of the case had been in accordance with domestic law as well as the Convention. In response, the applicant maintained, and developed the grounds for, his claim.

On 15 January 2015 the Chancellor of Justice rejected the applicant’s claim. As concerns the lack of an oral hearing, the Chancellor of Justice noted that the Social Insurance Office and the County Administrative Court had held an oral hearing and consequently, in accordance with the Court’s case-law, a less strict standard applied to the requirement to hold a hearing before the appellate court. Thus, in view of the character of the case and the fact that the applicant had been given the opportunity to finalise his submissions in writing and the court had had access to substantial written evidence, the Chancellor of Justice concluded that there had been no breach of the Convention in this respect.

As concerns the Administrative Court of Appeal’s alleged lack of reasoning, the Chancellor of Justice referred extensively to the Court’s case law on this matter and then made the following evaluation. The Administrative Court of Appeal had, in its judgment, accounted for the applicant’s arguments and the new evidence he had submitted before it. It had further accounted for the considerations and conclusions drawn from the evidence submitted by the parties, namely, that the investigation in the case did not demonstrate that the applicant had been exposed to any such harmful influences in his work which, with a high degree of probability, could have caused his problems. Thus, the Chancellor of Justice found that the Administrative Court of Appeal had taken a stance on the central and decisive question in the case, that is, whether the applicant had been exposed to harmful influences in his work. While the Chancellor noted that it would have been preferable, for pedagogical reasons, for the court to have given clearer grounds for why the applicant’s evidence had not been sufficient, she concluded that the reasoning was not so deficient that the applicant’s right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention had been infringed.

B. Relevant domestic law and practice

At the relevant time, provisions on work injuries were set out in the Work Injury Insurance Act (Lag (1976:380) om arbetsskadeförsäkring), which covered all people working in Sweden. A person whose ability to earn an income had been impaired due to a work-related injury was in some specified situations eligible for life annuity (Chapter 4, section 1). The term “work-related injury” referred to injuries resulting from accidents or other harmful effects at work. “Other harmful effect” meant the influence of a factor that with a high degree of probability might cause the kind of injury suffered (Chapter 2, section 1(1)). If an insured person had suffered an accident or another harmful effect, the injury was to be considered to have been caused by the harmful effect, if that causal link was highly probable (Chapter 2, section 2). The standard of proof was somewhat mitigated on 1 July 2002, but that amendment did not apply to the applicant’s case.

The administration of justice before the administrative courts is regulated by the Administrative Court Procedure Act (Förvaltningsprocesslagen, 1971:291). According to section 30 of the Act, the determination of a case by a court must be based on what is contained in the documents and what has otherwise been established in the case. The decision must state the reasons that determined the outcome.","{'applicant': 'Krzysztof Ruminski', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2017}",001-173265
330,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 17906/15) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Krzysztof Ruminski (“the applicant”), on 10 April 2015. He was represented before the Court by Ms A. Massarsch and later by Mr I. Vita, both lawyers practising in Stockholm.

The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms C. Hellner Kirstein, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

The applicant complained under Article 6 of the Convention that the Court of Appeal did not give adequate reasons for its judgment.

Mrs Helena Jäderblom, the judge elected in respect of Sweden, withdrew from the case (Rule 28). Accordingly, Mr Iain Thorburn Cameron was appointed to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 26 § 4 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).

On 25 August 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.

THE FACTS

A. The circumstances of the case

The applicant is a Swedish national born in 1950. He lives in Jordbro.

The applicant suffered for many years from, inter alia, pain in his back and legs and numbness in his right arm. He alternated between full and part-time sick leave from 1996 to 2001. In 1999 he received a partial early retirement pension and in 2002 a full disability pension.

In 2003 he applied for life annuity and alleged that his physical problems had been caused by his former employment as a driver (1973 to 1974), as a dairy worker (1974 to 1984) and as a food science technician (1984 to 1991). The Social Insurance Office (Försäkringskassan) appointed an in-house specialist in orthopaedic surgery who, in a written statement, concluded that there was not a high degree of probability (hög grad av sannolikhet) that any harmful element in the applicant’s former employment had caused his problems.

On 17 May 2005, after having held an oral hearing, the Social Insurance Office rejected the application. Referring to, inter alia, the specialist statement by the insurance doctor, it was held that the applicant had not been subject to any harmful influences which, with a high degree of probability, could have caused or aggravated his problems.

The applicant appealed to the County Administrative Court (förvaltningsrätten) of Stockholm. On 19 April 2007 the court, after having held an oral hearing, upheld the Social Insurance Office’s decision in full. The court found that, although it was scientifically known that employees in the food industry had a statistically high risk of injury, the circumstances in the applicant’s case had to be taken into account. The applicant’s back problems had appeared after barely two years in the industry and he suffered from degenerative changes to his back. Against that background, the medical investigation and other material did not adequately support the conclusion that the applicant, in his work, had been subject to any harmful influences which, with a high degree of probability, could have caused or aggravated his problems.

Upon further appeal to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten) of Stockholm, the applicant submitted, inter alia, a medical statement (epikris) issued in February 2008 by the Centre of Public Health, Occupational and Environmental Medicine (Centrum for folkhälsa, arbets‑ och miljömedicin). According to the medical statement, there were reasons to believe that the applicant’s work had caused his problems.

In a written statement to the appellate court, the Social Insurance Office questioned the conclusions in the medical statement as they were based on information about exposure which was to a high degree uncertain. Furthermore, there were medical records from 1997 in which the applicant was held to be fully able-bodied and in which it was noted that no somatic evidence had been found in support of the applicant’s symptoms.

On 17 March 2008, the Administrative Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal. The applicant requested an oral hearing in the case but, on 5 September 2008, the court rejected the request. It referred to the nature of the case and to the fact that an oral hearing had been held before the County Administrative Court. The applicant was given the opportunity to submit further observations.

In a judgment of 27 October 2008, the Administrative Court of Appeal upheld the lower court’s judgment in full. It first gave an account of the parties’ submissions and the evidence relied upon, including the medical statement of February 2008, and then stated the following reasons: “The medical and other evidence in the case does not demonstrate that the applicant has been exposed to any such harmful influences in his work which could, with a high degree of probability, have caused his problems. His back-related and other problems can thus – as has been found also by the County Administrative Court and the Social Insurance Office – not be defined as a work-related injury. [The applicant] is therefore not entitled to life annuity according to the [Work Injury Insurance Act]. The appeal must consequently be rejected.”

The applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen). He complained of the lack of reasoning in the Administrative Court of Appeal’s judgment and argued that that court’s refusal to hold an oral hearing had infringed his right to a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention.

On 4 August 2009, the Supreme Administrative Court refused leave to appeal.

On 3 February 2010 the applicant lodged an application with the Court, complaining that his right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention had been infringed because the Administrative Court of Appeal had refused to hold an oral hearing and its judgment had not been sufficiently reasoned.

This application was declared inadmissible by the Court on 21 May 2013 for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Court found that the applicant had failed to lodge a claim with the Chancellor of Justice (Justitiekanslern) or the ordinary courts to seek compensation for the alleged breaches of the Convention (Ruminski v. Sweden (dec.), no. 10404/10, 21 May 2013).

Consequently, on 30 December 2013, the applicant lodged a claim for compensation for the alleged breaches of the Convention with the Chancellor of Justice. He argued that the Administrative Court of Appeal’s lack of reasoning, as well as its refusal to hold an oral hearing, had infringed his right to a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. He requested 50,000 Swedish kronor (SEK) for non-pecuniary damage.

The Chancellor of Justice communicated the case to the Administrative Court of Appeal which submitted that its handling of the case had been in accordance with domestic law as well as the Convention. In response, the applicant maintained, and developed the grounds for, his claim.

On 15 January 2015 the Chancellor of Justice rejected the applicant’s claim. As concerns the lack of an oral hearing, the Chancellor of Justice noted that the Social Insurance Office and the County Administrative Court had held an oral hearing and consequently, in accordance with the Court’s case-law, a less strict standard applied to the requirement to hold a hearing before the appellate court. Thus, in view of the character of the case and the fact that the applicant had been given the opportunity to finalise his submissions in writing and the court had had access to substantial written evidence, the Chancellor of Justice concluded that there had been no breach of the Convention in this respect.

The case originated in an application (no. 37471/97) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Irish national, William Faulkner (“the applicant”), on 8 August 1996.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr P. Macdermott, a lawyer practising in Belfast. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr H. Llewellyn, Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant alleged, in particular, that the prison authorities had interfered with a letter from him to the Scottish Minister of State.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11). It was originally allocated to the Third Section of the Court, which declared it partly admissible on 18 September 2001.

On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). The application was allocated to the new Second Section of the Court. Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine).

The applicant, who was born in 1947, was released from detention in February 1999. Prior to that he was detained at HMP Magilligan, County Derry, Northern Ireland, on temporary transfer from a Scottish prison while serving a seven year sentence for a drug offence.

On 1 July 1996 a sealed letter sent by him to the Scottish Minister of State was returned to him by the prison authorities.

The applicant, who was born in 1947, was released from detention in February 1999. Prior to that he was detained at HMP Magilligan, County Derry, Northern Ireland, on temporary transfer from a Scottish prison while serving a seven year sentence for a drug offence.

On 1 July 1996 a sealed letter sent by him to the Scottish Minister of State was returned to him by the prison authorities. Following the Court’s admissibility decision, the Government informed the Court that the Prison Service was unable to explain why the letter had not been sent, since there was nothing untoward in its content.","{'applicant': 'William Faulkner', 'articles': [91, 34, 56, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2002}",001-60492
338,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 37471/97) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Irish national, William Faulkner (“the applicant”), on 8 August 1996.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr P. Macdermott, a lawyer practising in Belfast. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr H. Llewellyn, Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant alleged, in particular, that the prison authorities had interfered with a letter from him to the Scottish Minister of State.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11). It was originally allocated to the Third Section of the Court, which declared it partly admissible on 18 September 2001.

On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). The application was allocated to the new Second Section of the Court. Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine).

The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Wirral.

His wife died on 6 December 1996, leaving three children born in 1986, 1989 and 1990. His second claim for widows' benefits was made on 23 May 2000 and was rejected on 1 June 2000 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows' benefits because he was not a woman. On 26 July 2000 and 23 August 2000 the Benefits Agency confirmed the applicant's lack of appeal rights. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.","{'applicant': 'Barry Williams', 'articles': [91, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-84283

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Essex.

His wife died on 27 February 2000 having no children.

On around 4 April 2000 the applicant applied for benefits equivalent to those to which a widow, whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of his wife, would have been entitled, namely a Widow’s Payment and a Widow’s Pension, payable under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”). He was informed on 25 April 2000 that the Benefits Agency was unable to accept his application as a valid claim because there was at that time no legislation providing an equivalent of the widows’ benefits concerned to widowers. He was told that he had no right of appeal since his claim had not been considered by a decision-maker.

In or around September 2000 the applicant made a claim for Widow’s Bereavement Tax Allowance (“WBA”) to the Inland Revenue for the years 2000-2001. On 5 October 2000 he was informed that his claim could not be accepted because there was no basis in domestic law allowing widowers to claim this benefit.

On 24 November 2000 the applicant re-applied for WBA and on 28 November 2000 the Inland Revenue replied confirming its decision and asking the applicant if he wished to appeal.

On 30 November 2000 the applicant made a further claim for WBA which was rejected on 25 December 2000.

On 3 January 2001 the applicant wrote to the Inland Revenue asking for his appeal claim to be left open pending a domestic decision on the matter.

The case originated in an application (no. 73652/01) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Andrew Anderson (“the applicant”), on 31 May 2001.

The applicant was unrepresented before the Court. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities' refusal to grant him Widow's Bereavement Allowance or equivalent constituted discrimination on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

On 15 October 2002 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning Widow's Bereavement Allowance and to declare the remainder of the application inadmissible. It was subsequently decided under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

The applicant, but not the Government, filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

Following the judgment of the Grand Chamber in Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, 12 April 2006), the applicant and the Government submitted further observations.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Birmingham.

The applicant, aged sixty three, would not become eligible for a State pension until he was sixty five, whereas a woman could claim a State pension from age sixty. He was currently unemployed but if he returned to work he and any potential employer would be liable to make national insurance contributions.

On 4 February 2002, the applicant issued proceedings for damages in the High Court against the Benefits Agency, alleging inter alia that the refusal to pay him a pension from the age of sixty was discriminatory. On 2 October 2002, the applicant’s claim was struck out on the basis that the particulars of claim disclosed no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim (Civil Procedure Rule 3.4.2.). On 27 February 2003, permission to appeal was refused.","{'applicant': 'Sydney George Pearson', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2006}",001-76762

The case originated in an application (no. 17202/04) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Swedish national, Mr Freddie Andersson (“the applicant”), on 9 May 2004.

The applicant was represented by Ms Mia Andersson. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Anna Erman from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

The applicant alleged, in particular, that the administrative courts had failed to hold an oral hearing in proceedings relating to his request for occupational injury compensation.

By a decision of 3 June 2008, the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the lack of an oral hearing before the administrative courts to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of this complaint at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 1).

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1930 and lives in Ingarö.

In September 1996 the applicant submitted an occupational injury report (arbetsskadeanmälan) to the Social Insurance Office (Försäkringskassan –hereinafter “the Office”) of the County of Stockholm in which he requested that his lower back and hip joint problems be considered work-related, thereby making him eligible for occupational injury compensation (arbetsskadeersättning).

In a decision of 13 December 1996, the Office noted that the applicant had carried out heavy work as a slaughterhouse worker until 1982 when he had moved to the USA and worked on renovating walls. In 1988 the applicant had informed the Office that he could no longer carry out his work because of his hip joint problems. Thus, in June 1988, he had been granted early retirement pension on the ground that he suffered from lumbar spondylosis and coxarthritis (a degenerative joint disease of his lower back and right hip). On the basis of the above, the Office considered that it was possible that the applicant’s work in the USA had harmed him and, since it could only consider injuries which had occurred while working in Sweden, it could not examine the request.

Upon request by the applicant, the Office, on 17 February 1997, reconsidered its previous decision but decided not to change it.

The applicant appealed to the County Administrative Court (länsrätten) of the County of Stockholm, claiming that his injuries had been caused by his work in Sweden. He stated that he had created a company in the USA to import Swedish fibreglass fabric but that, in order to get his business going, he had had to include measuring, installing and painting. However, since he already had pain in his hip joint and lower back, he had not been able to carry out the work and had sold the company. He further added that he had worked in slaughterhouses between 1948 and 1980, which had involved very heavy work in difficult conditions. In support, he submitted a medical certificate from Dr S.R., who had been working as a company doctor for more than 20 years in the food industry and had been the applicant’s company doctor between 1967 and 1980. According to Dr S.R., the applicant’s injuries were work-related, noting that he had carried animal carcasses and heavy pieces of meat up and down stairs, causing extreme strain on the back, hips, knees and ankles. Moreover, the work had been carried out in humid, draughty premises and with slippery floors.

On 15 September 1997 the County Administrative Court repealed the Office’s decision and sent the case back for renewed examination. It found that the applicant’s injuries could well have been caused by his work in Sweden and that the Office had the duty to evaluate whether this was the case.

To prepare the case, the Office requested the opinion of one of its own medical doctors (försäkringsläkare), Dr S.H., as to whether the applicant’s injuries were work-related. The doctor, who was a specialist in orthopaedics, gave his opinion on 23 September 1997. It was based on the information in the Office’s case-file and stated essentially the following.

It appeared from other medical certificates that the applicant had been healthy until his hip joint problems began in 1985-86. In 1988 his right hip and lower back had been x-rayed, which showed that the hip joint had degenerative alterations, whereas the lower back was not remarked on, having regard to the applicant’s age. In July 1996 the applicant had undergone a hip joint operation. In Dr S.H.’s opinion, the applicant suffered from moderate arthritis in his hip joint, which had developed slowly from the age of 55 and thus was age-related, not work-related. In this respect, he claimed that there was no general support in scientific literature for the proposition that elements in the working environment could cause arthritis.

On 14 January 1998, the Office decided that the applicant could not be granted occupational injury compensation as it considered that his injuries were not related to his work in Sweden. In reaching its decision, it had put much emphasis on the opinion of Dr S.H., since he was a specialist in orthopaedics.

The applicant appealed to the County Administrative Court, maintaining that he was entitled to occupational injury compensation due to his injuries, which were clearly work-related. In support of his appeal, he submitted a medical certificate by Dr P.H., specialist in orthopaedic surgery, who had treated the applicant. According to Dr P.H., the applicant had suffered from serious joint arthritis of the right hip when he first met him during the spring of 1996, which had led to the operation in July 1996. As the illness did not run in the applicant’s family and it had developed at an earlier age in the applicant than was normal, Dr P.H. considered that it was probable that the injury had been caused by the applicant’s heavy work in the slaughterhouse. Moreover, in his view, the applicant’s work in the USA had in no way affected the development of the arthritis.

The Office disputed the appeal and submitted that Dr P.H.’s opinion did not clearly show that the applicant’s work at the slaughterhouse had caused his injuries.

In May 1998 the applicant contacted the County Administrative Court and requested that an oral hearing be held in his case so that he could describe his working situation. However, by decision of 25 May 1998, the court rejected the request as it found that it was unnecessary with regard to the nature of the subject matter. The applicant was given three weeks in which to finalise his submissions.

On 29 June 1999, when asked by the County Administrative Court, the applicant renewed his request for an oral hearing but sent on the same day a fax to the court explaining that he did not request an oral hearing.

On 29 June 1999 the County Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s appeal. It did not question that his work had been of a very heavy nature. However, it noted that it had to be relatively widely accepted that certain factors in the working environment, with a high level of probability, could cause the relevant injuries. In the present case, the court found that the applicant had failed to show that there was a high level of probability that his work at the slaughterhouse had caused his hip joint arthritis.

The applicant made a further appeal to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten) in Stockholm, maintaining his claims and adding that he wanted an oral hearing to be held so that he could prove his case, inter alia, by describing his working conditions in the slaughterhouse and developing the medical investigation. In this respect, he referred to Article 6 of the Convention and noted that he would later specify whom he wanted to call as expert witnesses.

Furthermore, the applicant submitted another medical certificate which supported his claim that his injuries were work-related. It was written by Dr H.B., specialist in orthopaedics, who had examined the applicant. In the certificate, Dr H.B. stated that studies existed which indicated a connection between heavy physical work and the development of hip joint arthritis. There were also studies which showed that the risk of developing hip joint arthritis increased with the number of tons that a person lifted during his working life. Having regard to the applicant’s background, his work at the slaughterhouse and the relatively young age at which he had developed the arthritis, Dr H.B. concluded that there were much stronger reasons in support of a connection between the applicant’s injuries and his work than against it.

The Office disputed the applicant’s appeal and the new medical certificate, submitting that the appeal should be rejected.

On 28 June 2001 the Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s request for an oral hearing as it considered that, with regard to the nature of the subject mater, it was unnecessary to hold a hearing. The court granted the applicant two weeks to finalise his submissions in the case.

Subsequently, on 24 September 2001, the Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the appeal. Having regard to the medical investigation in the case, in particular the opinion of Dr S.H., as well as the time aspect (the applicant had stopped working in 1980 at the slaughterhouse but only been operated on in 1996), the court found that it had not been shown, with a high level of probability, that the work had caused the applicant’s injuries.

The applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsrätten) and requested that an oral hearing be held. He stressed that the lower courts had failed to hold a hearing, despite his express request and in violation of Article 6 of the Convention. Moreover, he submitted that a hearing was necessary in order for him to describe his working conditions at the slaughterhouse and to be able to question specialists to clarify his injuries and their causes.

On 16 July 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s request for an oral hearing as it considered that there was no need for a hearing before it decided on whether or not to grant leave to appeal. It gave the applicant three weeks to submit any additional comments.

On 10 November 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court refused leave to appeal.","{'applicant': 'Freddie Andersson', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2010}",001-102115

The case originated in an application (no. 17202/04) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Swedish national, Mr Freddie Andersson (“the applicant”), on 9 May 2004.

The applicant was represented by Ms Mia Andersson. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Anna Erman from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

The applicant alleged, in particular, that the administrative courts had failed to hold an oral hearing in proceedings relating to his request for occupational injury compensation.

By a decision of 3 June 2008, the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the lack of an oral hearing before the administrative courts to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of this complaint at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 1).

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1930 and lives in Ingarö.

In September 1996 the applicant submitted an occupational injury report (arbetsskadeanmälan) to the Social Insurance Office (Försäkringskassan –hereinafter “the Office”) of the County of Stockholm in which he requested that his lower back and hip joint problems be considered work-related, thereby making him eligible for occupational injury compensation (arbetsskadeersättning).

In a decision of 13 December 1996, the Office noted that the applicant had carried out heavy work as a slaughterhouse worker until 1982 when he had moved to the USA and worked on renovating walls. In 1988 the applicant had informed the Office that he could no longer carry out his work because of his hip joint problems. Thus, in June 1988, he had been granted early retirement pension on the ground that he suffered from lumbar spondylosis and coxarthritis (a degenerative joint disease of his lower back and right hip).

The case originated in an application (no. 27319/07) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Ümit Onur (“the applicant”), on 29 June 2007.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr James Elliott of Wilson and Co., Solicitors, a lawyer practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Derek Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

On 17 July 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, Mr Ümit Onur, is a Turkish national who was born in 1978 and now lives in Turkey. He is of Kurdish origin.

The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.

In 1989 the applicant, who was then eleven years old, arrived in the United Kingdom with his father, his brother and his four sisters to join his mother, who had arrived six weeks earlier. The applicant’s father claimed asylum. The claim was refused but the family were granted Exceptional Leave to Remain which was periodically extended. In 1999 the applicant, his father and his other family members were granted Indefinite Leave to Remain. At an unspecified date his mother, father and three of his sisters were granted British nationality. One of the applicant’s sisters left the United Kingdom for Turkey in 1993 and the family believe she may be in Iraq. The applicant’s father died in 2006. His mother, brother and three of his sisters continue to reside in the United Kingdom.

The applicant stated that he had not returned to Turkey since his departure in 1989 but he could still speak Turkish. It is not clear whether he received any education in Turkey, although it appears that he received some schooling in the United Kingdom. He is a chef by profession although there is little information available regarding his employment history.

In 1994 he commenced a relationship with a British citizen. The relationship lasted six years, but during this time the applicant was convicted on seven occasions for a number of different offences. On 10 May 1996 he was convicted for driving whilst disqualified and sentenced to fifty hours’ community service. Two months later he was convicted of burglary and given an eighteen month probation order. Later that same year he was convicted of aggravated burglary and sentenced to eight months of youth custody. On 28 April 1997 he was fined GBP 30 following a conviction for possession of cannabis. On 12 September 1997 he was again convicted of possession of cannabis and sentenced to one day’s imprisonment. On 4 October 1997 he was convicted of two counts of burglary and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment.

On 5 June 2000, the applicant pleaded guilty to robbery at Wood Green Crown Court. The trial judge noted that the applicant had been one of the ringleaders of the robbery, during which two of the four robbers carried weapons. He imposed a sentence of four and a half years’ imprisonment but made no recommendation regarding the applicant’s deportation from the United Kingdom.

The applicant’s relationship with his partner ended when he was imprisoned. Shortly afterwards, in 2000, his partner gave birth to a daughter. The applicant is not named as the father on the birth certificate although his mother cared for the child until she was three years old.

On 7 September 2001 the Secretary of State for the Home Department wrote to the applicant to notify him that he was considering his immigration status and his liability to deportation in light of his conviction of 5 June 2000. The applicant was invited to make representations within twenty-eight days, but the representations made on his behalf were not answered and no further action was taken at that stage. Following the applicant’s release on 21 January 2003, his solicitors wrote to the Home Office to seek clarification of his position, but still no formal action was taken.

On 18 May 2005 the applicant was convicted of a road traffic offence and a failure to surrender to custody. He was given a sentence of twenty-eight days’ imprisonment, a fine of GBP 200 and disqualified from driving for nine months.

In April 2006 the Secretary of State for the Home Office admitted that 1023 foreign national criminals, who should have been considered for deportation or removal, had completed their prison sentences and were released without any consideration of deportation or removal action. The news was widely reported in the British media and resulted in urgent action being taken by the Home Office to improve performance and crack down on foreign national criminals.

In 2005 the applicant began a relationship with a British citizen. On 24 September 2006 the couple entered into a non-legally binding marriage by Kurdish rite (“the marriage”) and their first child was born on 4 March 2007. A second child was born on 21 January 2008.

The applicant was served with an undated Notice of Decision to Make a Deportation Order on 1 October 2006. A letter entitled “Reasons for Deportation” had been prepared on 6 July 2006 on behalf of the Immigration Service Border Control and Enforcement Unit. It stated that in view of the applicant’s conviction for robbery on 5 June 2000, the Secretary of State for the Home Department deemed it conducive to the public good to make a deportation order. The letter was signed and countersigned but it was not served on the applicant. On 5 September 2006 it was amended and reprinted. This amended letter was served on the applicant on 1 October 2006 together with the Notice of Decision to Make a Deportation Order. The amended letter entitled “Reasons for Deportation” set out all of the applicant’s convictions, including that of 18 May 2005. It concluded that: “Full consideration has been given to all the known facts of your case in line with paragraphs 364 of HC 395 (as amended). Your personal and domestic circumstances have been carefully balanced against the seriousness of your crime and need to protect the wider community. It is concluded that in your case it is appropriate to deport you to Turkey.”

The applicant appealed to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (“the AIT”), relying, inter alia, on Article 8 of the Convention. The Secretary of State requested an oral hearing. In the document setting out this request, the Secretary of State twice indicated that the decision to make a deportation order had been taken on 6 July 2006.

Before the AIT, the applicant argued, first, that the decision to deport him was not in accordance with the law. The relevant paragraph of the Immigration Rules, paragraph 364, had changed on 20 July 2006. The earlier version of the rule required the Secretary of State to conduct a balancing exercise between the public interest and any compassionate circumstances of the case, taking into account all relevant factors. The post-20 July 2006 version of the rule established a presumption that the public interest required deportation. The Secretary of State would consider all relevant factors in considering whether the presumption was outweighed in a particular case, but it would be only in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation would be outweighed in a case where it would not be contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights or the Refugee Convention to deport. The applicant argued that the decision to deport him had been taken on 6 July 2006 and thus his case should have been considered under the old version of paragraph 364, which was more favourable to him.

Secondly, the applicant argued that in light of his extensive private and family life in the United Kingdom and the length of his stay there, the decision to deport him was a violation of Article 8. He also submitted a report prepared by a consultant clinical psychologist who diagnosed him as having mild to moderate depression, panic disorder, mild mental retardation, borderline intellectual functioning and dyslexia.

In a determination dated 20 February 2007, the AIT dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It found that the relevant date for the decision to deport was 1 October 2006, as the decision had remained incomplete until it was communicated to the applicant, and as a consequence his deportation fell to be considered under the later version of paragraph 364. In the alternative, the AIT found that if it was wrong in this conclusion and therefore had to conduct a balancing exercise pursuant to the earlier version of paragraph 364, it would have come to the same conclusion. The AIT also held that there had been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention.

The applicant applied for reconsideration of the AIT’s decision. On 19 March 2007 a Senior Immigration Judge refused the application, holding that although the AIT had concluded that the decision to deport was made after paragraph 364 was amended, it had also considered the alternative. All relevant matters were considered by the AIT and no material error of law was disclosed.

The applicant’s application for statutory review was dismissed by the High Court on 16 May 2007. On 8 June 2007 the deportation order in respect of the applicant was signed and it was served on him on 27 June 2007. On 11 July 2007 the applicant lodged an application for judicial review of the AIT’s decision not to make an order for reconsideration, and applied to have the deportation revoked. The applicant was deported to Turkey on 12 July 2007.

On 16 July 2007 the application to revoke the deportation order was refused by the Secretary of State. On 10 October 2007 the High Court dismissed the judicial review application. The applicant brought an out-of-country appeal against this decision but the appeal was dismissed under both the Immigration Rules and Article 8 of the Convention on 17 July 2008.","{'applicant': 'Ümit Onur', 'articles': [91, 34, 56, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2009}",001-91286

The case originated in an application (no. 27319/07) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Ümit Onur (“the applicant”), on 29 June 2007.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr James Elliott of Wilson and Co., Solicitors, a lawyer practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Derek Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

On 17 July 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, Mr Ümit Onur, is a Turkish national who was born in 1978 and now lives in Turkey. He is of Kurdish origin.

The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.

In 1989 the applicant, who was then eleven years old, arrived in the United Kingdom with his father, his brother and his four sisters to join his mother, who had arrived six weeks earlier. The applicant’s father claimed asylum. The claim was refused but the family were granted Exceptional Leave to Remain which was periodically extended. In 1999 the applicant, his father and his other family members were granted Indefinite Leave to Remain. At an unspecified date his mother, father and three of his sisters were granted British nationality. One of the applicant’s sisters left the United Kingdom for Turkey in 1993 and the family believe she may be in Iraq. The applicant’s father died in 2006. His mother, brother and three of his sisters continue to reside in the United Kingdom.

The applicant stated that he had not returned to Turkey since his departure in 1989 but he could still speak Turkish. It is not clear whether he received any education in Turkey, although it appears that he received some schooling in the United Kingdom. He is a chef by profession although there is little information available regarding his employment history.

In 1994 he commenced a relationship with a British citizen. The relationship lasted six years, but during this time the applicant was convicted on seven occasions for a number of different offences. On 10 May 1996 he was convicted for driving whilst disqualified and sentenced to fifty hours’ community service. Two months later he was convicted of burglary and given an eighteen month probation order. Later that same year he was convicted of aggravated burglary and sentenced to eight months of youth custody. On 28 April 1997 he was fined GBP 30 following a conviction for possession of cannabis. On 12 September 1997 he was again convicted of possession of cannabis and sentenced to one day’s imprisonment. On 4 October 1997 he was convicted of two counts of burglary and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment.

On 5 June 2000, the applicant pleaded guilty to robbery at Wood Green Crown Court. The trial judge noted that the applicant had been one of the ringleaders of the robbery, during which two of the four robbers carried weapons. He imposed a sentence of four and a half years’ imprisonment but made no recommendation regarding the applicant’s deportation from the United Kingdom.

The applicant’s relationship with his partner ended when he was imprisoned. Shortly afterwards, in 2000, his partner gave birth to a daughter. The applicant is not named as the father on the birth certificate although his mother cared for the child until she was three years old.

On 7 September 2001 the Secretary of State for the Home Department wrote to the applicant to notify him that he was considering his immigration status and his liability to deportation in light of his conviction of 5 June 2000. The applicant was invited to make representations within twenty-eight days, but the representations made on his behalf were not answered and no further action was taken at that stage. Following the applicant’s release on 21 January 2003, his solicitors wrote to the Home Office to seek clarification of his position, but still no formal action was taken.

On 18 May 2005 the applicant was convicted of a road traffic offence and a failure to surrender to custody. He was given a sentence of twenty-eight days’ imprisonment, a fine of GBP 200 and disqualified from driving for nine months.

In April 2006 the Secretary of State for the Home Office admitted that 1023 foreign national criminals, who should have been considered for deportation or removal, had completed their prison sentences and were released without any consideration of deportation or removal action. The news was widely reported in the British media and resulted in urgent action being taken by the Home Office to improve performance and crack down on foreign national criminals.

In 2005 the applicant began a relationship with a British citizen. On 24 September 2006 the couple entered into a non-legally binding marriage by Kurdish rite (“the marriage”) and their first child was born on 4 March 2007. A second child was born on 21 January 2008.

The applicant was served with an undated Notice of Decision to Make a Deportation Order on 1 October 2006. A letter entitled “Reasons for Deportation” had been prepared on 6 July 2006 on behalf of the Immigration Service Border Control and Enforcement Unit. It stated that in view of the applicant’s conviction for robbery on 5 June 2000, the Secretary of State for the Home Department deemed it conducive to the public good to make a deportation order. The letter was signed and countersigned but it was not served on the applicant. On 5 September 2006 it was amended and reprinted. This amended letter was served on the applicant on 1 October 2006 together with the Notice of Decision to Make a Deportation Order. The amended letter entitled “Reasons for Deportation” set out all of the applicant’s convictions, including that of 18 May 2005. It concluded that: “Full consideration has been given to all the known facts of your case in line with paragraphs 364 of HC 395 (as amended). Your personal and domestic circumstances have been carefully balanced against the seriousness of your crime and need to protect the wider community. It is concluded that in your case it is appropriate to deport you to Turkey.”

The applicant appealed to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (“the AIT”), relying, inter alia, on Article 8 of the Convention. The Secretary of State requested an oral hearing.

On 11 July 2007 the applicant lodged an application for judicial review of the AIT’s decision not to make an order for reconsideration, and applied to have the deportation revoked. The applicant was deported to Turkey on 12 July 2007.

On 16 July 2007 the application to revoke the deportation order was refused by the Secretary of State. On 10 October 2007 the High Court dismissed the judicial review application.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, Mr Ümit Onur, is a Turkish national who was born in 1978 and now lives in Turkey. He is of Kurdish origin.

The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.

In 1989 the applicant, who was then eleven years old, arrived in the United Kingdom with his father, his brother and his four sisters to join his mother, who had arrived six weeks earlier. The applicant’s father claimed asylum. The claim was refused but the family were granted Exceptional Leave to Remain which was periodically extended.

One of the applicant’s sisters left the United Kingdom for Turkey in 1993 and the family believe she may be in Iraq. The applicant’s father died in 2006. His mother, brother and three of his sisters continue to reside in the United Kingdom.

The applicant stated that he had not returned to Turkey since his departure in 1989 but he could still speak Turkish. It is not clear whether he received any education in Turkey, although it appears that he received some schooling in the United Kingdom.

406,"PROCEDURE

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 28 May 1996, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (“the Government“) also applied to refer the case to the Court on 27 August 1996 (see paragraph 6 below). It originated in an application (no. 20605/92) against the United Kingdom lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by Ms Alison Halford, a British citizen, on 22 April 1992. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 8, 10, 13 and 14 of the Convention (art. 8, art. 10, art. 13, art. 14).

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that she wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent her (Rule 30).

The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 4 (b)). On 10 June 1996, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr C. Russo, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr I. Foighel, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha and Mr P. Kuris (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43).

As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Deputy Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial on 2 January 1997 and the applicant’s memorial on 6 January 1997.

On 20 August 1996 Mr Bernhardt had granted leave to Liberty, a non-governmental human rights organisation based in London, to submit written comments on specified aspects of the case (Rule 37 para. 2). These were received on 2 January 1997.

On 21 February 1997, the Chamber decided to reject the Government’s application to refer the case to the Court, on the grounds that it was received after the expiry of the three-month period laid down by Articles 32 para. 1 and 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47) and that there was no exceptional reason for extending the time-limit.

In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 17 March 1997. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr M. Eaton, Deputy Legal Adviser, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr J. Eadie, Barrister-at-Law, Counsel, Mr H. Carter, Home Office, Mr P. Regan, Home Office, Mr C. Raikes, Department of Trade and Industry, Advisers; (b) for the Commission Mrs J. Liddy, Delegate; (c) for the applicant Mr R. Makin, Solicitor, Mr P. Duffy, Barrister-at-Law, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mrs Liddy, Mr Makin, Mr Duffy and Mr Eadie and also the answer to a question put by one of its members.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. Circumstances of the case

The applicant, Ms Alison Halford, was born in 1940 and lives in the Wirral. From 1962 until her retirement in 1992 she worked in the police service.

A. Background to the alleged telephone interceptions

In May 1983 Ms Halford was appointed to the rank of Assistant Chief Constable with the Merseyside police. As such she became the most senior-ranking female police officer in the United Kingdom.

On eight occasions during the following seven years, Ms Halford applied unsuccessfully to be appointed to the rank of Deputy Chief Constable, in response to vacancies arising within Merseyside and other police authorities. In order to be considered for promotion to this rank, Home Office approval was required. However, according to the applicant, this was consistently withheld on the recommendation of the Chief Constable of the Merseyside police, who objected to her commitment to equality of treatment between men and women.

Following a further refusal to promote her in February 1990, Ms Halford commenced proceedings on 4 June 1990 in the Industrial Tribunal against, inter alia, the Chief Constable of Merseyside and the Home Secretary, claiming that she had been discriminated against on grounds of sex. On 14 June 1990, the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Merseyside Police Authority were designated a “Special Committee“ to handle the issues arising from the discrimination case.

Ms Halford alleges that certain members of the Merseyside Police Authority launched a “campaign“ against her in response to her complaint to the Industrial Tribunal. This took the form, inter alia, of leaks to the press, interception of her telephone calls (see paragraph 16 below) and the decision to bring disciplinary proceedings against her.

Thus, on 14 September 1990, the Special Committee referred to the Senior Officers’ Disciplinary Committee a report written by the Chief Constable about an alleged incident of misconduct on the part of Ms Halford on 24 July 1990. The Disciplinary Committee resolved, on 20 September 1990, to hold a formal investigation and to refer the matter to the Police Complaints Authority and, on 8 February 1991, to press charges. Ms Halford was suspended from duty on full pay from 12 December 1990.

She challenged the above decisions by way of judicial review in the High Court. The matter was adjourned by Mr Justice MacPherson in September 1991 in view of a possible settlement. However, the parties failed to reach agreement and the matter came back before him on 20 December 1991. He found that the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Police Authority had acted ultra vires and, without imputing ill-motive to them, held that there had been an element of unfairness. He therefore quashed the relevant decisions.

The hearing before the Industrial Tribunal took place in June 1992. On 14 July 1992 the proceedings were adjourned pending negotiation between the parties, which led to settlement of the case. Ms Halford was given an ex gratia payment of 10,000 pounds sterling (GBP) by the Chief Constable (the statutory maximum which the Industrial Tribunal could have awarded), together with GBP 5,000 towards her personal expenses by the Home Secretary. It was agreed that she would retire from the police force on medical grounds (arising out of an injury to her knee in 1989). In addition, the Home Office agreed to implement various proposals put by the Equal Opportunities Commission, inter alia to update and review selection procedures for senior posts within the police force.

B. The alleged interceptions

As Assistant Chief Constable, Ms Halford was provided with her own office and two telephones, one of which was for private use. These telephones were part of the Merseyside police internal telephone network, a telecommunications system outside the public network. No restrictions were placed on the use of these telephones and no guidance was given to her, save for an assurance which she sought and received from the Chief Constable shortly after she instituted the proceedings in the Industrial Tribunal that she had authorisation to attend to the case while on duty, including by telephone. In addition, since she was frequently “on call“, a substantial part of her home telephone costs were paid by the Merseyside police. Her home telephone consisted of a telephone apparatus connected, through the “network termination point“, to the public telecommunications network.

She alleges that calls made from her home and her office telephones were intercepted for the purposes of obtaining information to use against her in the discrimination proceedings. In support of these allegations she adduced various items of evidence before the Commission (see paragraph 21 of the Commission’s report). In addition, she informed the Court that she was told by an anonymous source on 16 April 1991 that, shortly before, the source had discovered the Merseyside police checking transcripts of conversations made on her home telephone. For the purposes of the case before the Court, the Government accepted that the applicant had adduced sufficient material to establish a reasonable likelihood that calls made from her office telephones were intercepted. They did not, however, accept that she had adduced sufficient material to establish such a reasonable likelihood in relation to her home telephone.

Ms Halford raised her concerns about the interception of her calls before the Industrial Tribunal on 17 June 1992. On 2 July 1992, in the course of the hearing, counsel for the Home Secretary expressed the opinion that it was not possible for her to adduce evidence about the alleged interceptions before the Industrial Tribunal because section 9 of the Interception of Communications Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act“) expressly excluded the calling of evidence before any court or tribunal which tended to suggest that an offence under section 1 of the Act had been committed (see paragraph 25 below).

On 6 December 1991 Ms Halford applied to the Interception of Communications Tribunal (“the Tribunal“) for an investigation under section 7 of the 1985 Act (see paragraphs 30-32 below). In a letter dated 21 February 1992, the Tribunal informed her that its investigation had satisfied it that there had been no contravention of sections 2 to 5 of the 1985 Act in her case (see paragraphs 26-29 below). In a letter dated 27 March 1992, the Tribunal confirmed that it could not specify whether any interception had in fact taken place (see paragraph 32 below).

In a letter to Mr David Alton MP dated 4 August 1992, the Home Secretary explained that Ms Halford’s complaint regarding the interception of calls made from her office telephones “[did] not fall within [his] responsibilities as Home Secretary nor within the terms of the [1985] Act“.","{'applicant': 'Alison Halford', 'articles': [91, 34, 56, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 48, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1997}",001-58039
407,"PROCEDURE

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 28 May 1996, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (“the Government“) also applied to refer the case to the Court on 27 August 1996 (see paragraph 6 below). It originated in an application (no. 20605/92) against the United Kingdom lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by Ms Alison Halford, a British citizen, on 22 April 1992. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 8, 10, 13 and 14 of the Convention (art. 8, art. 10, art. 13, art. 14).

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that she wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent her (Rule 30).

The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 4 (b)). On 10 June 1996, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr C. Russo, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr I. Foighel, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha and Mr P. Kuris (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43).

As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Deputy Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial on 2 January 1997 and the applicant’s memorial on 6 January 1997.

On 20 August 1996 Mr Bernhardt had granted leave to Liberty, a non-governmental human rights organisation based in London, to submit written comments on specified aspects of the case (Rule 37 para. 2). These were received on 2 January 1997.

On 21 February 1997, the Chamber decided to reject the Government’s application to refer the case to the Court, on the grounds that it was received after the expiry of the three-month period laid down by Articles 32 para. 1 and 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47) and that there was no exceptional reason for extending the time-limit.

In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 17 March 1997. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr M. Eaton, Deputy Legal Adviser, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr J. Eadie, Barrister-at-Law, Counsel, Mr H. Carter, Home Office, Mr P. Regan, Home Office, Mr C. Raikes, Department of Trade and Industry, Advisers; (b) for the Commission Mrs J. Liddy, Delegate; (c) for the applicant Mr R. Makin, Solicitor, Mr P. Duffy, Barrister-at-Law, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mrs Liddy, Mr Makin, Mr Duffy and Mr Eadie and also the answer to a question put by one of its members.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. Circumstances of the case

The applicant, Ms Alison Halford, was born in 1940 and lives in the Wirral. From 1962 until her retirement in 1992 she worked in the police service.

A. Background to the alleged telephone interceptions

In May 1983 Ms Halford was appointed to the rank of Assistant Chief Constable with the Merseyside police. As such she became the most senior-ranking female police officer in the United Kingdom.

On eight occasions during the following seven years, Ms Halford applied unsuccessfully to be appointed to the rank of Deputy Chief Constable, in response to vacancies arising within Merseyside and other police authorities. In order to be considered for promotion to this rank, Home Office approval was required. However, according to the applicant, this was consistently withheld on the recommendation of the Chief Constable of the Merseyside police, who objected to her commitment to equality of treatment between men and women.

Following a further refusal to promote her in February 1990, Ms Halford commenced proceedings on 4 June 1990 in the Industrial Tribunal against, inter alia, the Chief Constable of Merseyside and the Home Secretary, claiming that she had been discriminated against on grounds of sex. On 14 June 1990, the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Merseyside Police Authority were designated a “Special Committee“ to handle the issues arising from the discrimination case.

Ms Halford alleges that certain members of the Merseyside Police Authority launched a “campaign“ against her in response to her complaint to the Industrial Tribunal. This took the form, inter alia, of leaks to the press, interception of her telephone calls (see paragraph 16 below) and the decision to bring disciplinary proceedings against her.

Thus, on 14 September 1990, the Special Committee referred to the Senior Officers’ Disciplinary Committee a report written by the Chief Constable about an alleged incident of misconduct on the part of Ms Halford on 24 July 1990. The Disciplinary Committee resolved, on 20 September 1990, to hold a formal investigation and to refer the matter to the Police Complaints Authority and, on 8 February 1991, to press charges. Ms Halford was suspended from duty on full pay from 12 December 1990.

She challenged the above decisions by way of judicial review in the High Court. The matter was adjourned by Mr Justice MacPherson in September 1991 in view of a possible settlement. However, the parties failed to reach agreement and the matter came back before him on 20 December 1991. He found that the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Police Authority had acted ultra vires and, without imputing ill-motive to them, held that there had been an element of unfairness. He therefore quashed the relevant decisions.

The hearing before the Industrial Tribunal took place in June 1992. On 14 July 1992 the proceedings were adjourned pending negotiation between the parties, which led to settlement of the case. Ms Halford was given an ex gratia payment of 10,000 pounds sterling (GBP) by the Chief Constable (the statutory maximum which the Industrial Tribunal could have awarded), together with GBP 5,000 towards her personal expenses by the Home Secretary. It was agreed that she would retire from the police force on medical grounds (arising out of an injury to her knee in 1989). In addition, the Home Office agreed to implement various proposals put by the Equal Opportunities Commission, inter alia to update and review selection procedures for senior posts within the police force.

B. The alleged interceptions

As Assistant Chief Constable, Ms Halford was provided with her own office and two telephones, one of which was for private use. These telephones were part of the Merseyside police internal telephone network, a telecommunications system outside the public network. No restrictions were placed on the use of these telephones and no guidance was given to her, save for an assurance which she sought and received from the Chief Constable shortly after she instituted the proceedings in the Industrial Tribunal that she had authorisation to attend to the case while on duty, including by telephone. In addition, since she was frequently “on call“, a substantial part of her home telephone costs were paid by the Merseyside police. Her home telephone consisted of a telephone apparatus connected, through the “network termination point“, to the public telecommunications network.

She alleges that calls made from her home and her office telephones were intercepted for the purposes of obtaining information to use against her in the discrimination proceedings. In support of these allegations she adduced various items of evidence before the Commission (see paragraph 21 of the Commission’s report). In addition, she informed the Court that she was told by an anonymous source on 16 April 1991 that, shortly before, the source had discovered the Merseyside police checking transcripts of conversations made on her home telephone. For the purposes of the case before the Court, the Government accepted that the applicant had adduced sufficient material to establish a reasonable likelihood that calls made from her office telephones were intercepted. They did not, however, accept that she had adduced sufficient material to establish such a reasonable likelihood in relation to her home telephone.

Ms Halford raised her concerns about the interception of her calls before the Industrial Tribunal on 17 June 1992. On 2 July 1992, in the course of the hearing, counsel for the Home Secretary expressed the opinion that it was not possible for her to adduce evidence about the alleged interceptions before the Industrial Tribunal because section 9 of the Interception of Communications Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act“) expressly excluded the calling of evidence before any court or tribunal which tended to suggest that an offence under section 1 of the Act had been committed (see paragraph 25 below).

On 6 December 1991 Ms Halford applied to the Interception of Communications Tribunal (“the Tribunal“) for an investigation under section 7 of the 1985 Act (see paragraphs 30-32 below). In a letter dated 21 February 1992, the Tribunal informed her that its investigation had satisfied it that there had been no contravention of sections 2 to 5 of the 1985 Act in her case (see paragraphs 26-29 below). In a letter dated 27 March 1992, the Tribunal confirmed that it could not specify whether any interception had in fact taken place (see paragraph 32 below).

In a letter to Mr David Alton MP dated 4 August 1992, the Home Secretary explained that Ms Halford’s complaint regarding the interception of calls made from her office telephones “[did] not fall within [his] responsibilities as Home Secretary nor within the terms of the [1985] Act“.","{'applicant': 'Alison Halford', 'articles': [91, 34, 56, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 48, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1997}",001-58039
408,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 11320/05) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Swedish national, Mr John Iselsten (“the applicant”), on 11 March 2005.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr P.-O. Nordh, a lawyer practising in Vallentuna. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr B. Sjöberg, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

On 4 January 2007 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of an oral hearing before the Court of Appeal to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1932 and lives in Stockholm. He is a lawyer.

On 17 March 1997 he sued the Swedish State for damages before the District Court (tingsrätten) of Stockholm, claiming negligence in the administration of his bankruptcy. The applicant requested that the court render a declaratory judgment (fastställelsetalan), establishing that the State was liable for damage allegedly caused by negligence during the Enforcement Service’s administration of his bankruptcy in 1987/88.

The District Court, in June 1997, ordered the applicant to specify his claims and to elaborate further the grounds for these claims. Upon a request by the applicant, the court granted him an extension of the time-limit for submitting the supplementary material. On 20 August 1997, the court received the applicant’s submissions, which included 57 annexes.

On 29 October 1997 the District Court, without having issued a summons, rejected the applicant’s claim as being clearly unfounded.

The applicant appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal (hovrätten) and demanded that the case be remitted to the lower court for proper examination. The Court of Appeal, in June 1998, requested the applicant to supplement his appeal and to specify his claims. After having been granted an extension of the time-limit, the applicant complied with the request.

In a judgment of 17 December 1998, the Court of Appeal set aside the lower court’s judgment as far as the applicant’s claim relating to damage allegedly caused by the Enforcement Service’s administration of his bankruptcy was concerned and remitted the case to the District Court for proper examination. However, the Court of Appeal also decided not to allow the applicant to plead that the State was responsible for damage caused by an alleged breach of contract by the Enforcement Service.

The applicant appealed against the judgment to the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen), seeking leave to invoke the alleged breach of contract. On 23 April 1999, the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal.

The proceedings were then re-initiated before the District Court, which, in June 1999, issued a summons to the State, represented by the National Tax Board (Riksskatteverket). The State disputed the claims and the applicant was given the opportunity to comment on the State’s submissions. After having been granted two extensions of the time-limit due to ill-health, the applicant had his third such request for an extension rejected. The court called the parties to a preparatory meeting to be held on 18 January 2000. As the meeting could not be finalised in one day, it was resumed on 21 February 2000. The parties were subsequently requested to submit the evidence invoked. The applicant asked for, and was granted, another three extensions of the time-limit during the spring and summer before submitting all the requested material. During the autumn of 2000 both parties submitted comments relating to, inter alia, the oral evidence invoked and the schedule for the oral hearing. Due to the applicant’s health problems, the main hearing was eventually scheduled for 23 and 24 January 2001. During the hearing, four witnesses were heard and extensive written evidence was produced.

On 21 February 2001 the District Court rejected the applicant’s claim for damage as it did not find that the Enforcement Service’s administration of the bankruptcy had been negligent.

The applicant appealed against the judgment to the Court of Appeal, requesting that the case be remitted to the lower court or, in the alternative, that his claims be upheld. He further asked to be heard under oath (sanningsförsäkran) before the Court of Appeal and for the four witnesses to be heard again. The State submitted its reply to the applicant’s submissions on 6 August 2001.

On 30 December 2003 the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s request to have the case remitted to the District Court. It further refused to allow the applicant to invoke certain new evidence, and to be heard under oath, since he had not shown that he had a valid excuse for having failed to produce the evidence previously before the lower court. At the same time, the court informed the parties that it was considering adjudicating the case without holding an oral hearing. Thus, the parties were given the opportunity to state their view on this matter and to conclude their submissions. The State consented to the case being decided upon without a main hearing, whereas the applicant opposed it.

In a judgment of 10 June 2004, the Court of Appeal upheld the lower court’s judgment in full, noting that the parties had essentially invoked and developed the circumstances on which their claims were based in the same manner as before the District Court and that they had invoked written evidence. The Court of Appeal found no reason to depart from the evaluation of the case made by the lower court. As concerned its decision not to hold an oral hearing the court stated that, according to the relevant rules in the Code of Judicial Procedure, an appeal could always be adjudicated without a main hearing if it was clear that such a hearing was unnecessary. The court then considered that it was clear that a main hearing was unnecessary in the case before it in view of the investigation of the matter at hand. The fact that the applicant opposed the determination of the case without a hearing was immaterial as the issues of law raised in the case had been elucidated at the District Court in a way that made it obvious that a main hearing would not add anything of value to the case. Hence, the court found that there was no impediment to the case being adjudicated without a main hearing.

On 20 July 2004 the applicant’s appeal reached the Supreme Court and he asked for, and was granted, an extension of the time-limit to supplement his appeal. In August 2004 he submitted his supplementary pleadings and, on 14 September 2004, the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal.","{'applicant': 'John Iselsten', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-89321

On 20 July 2004 the applicant’s appeal reached the Supreme Court and he asked for, and was granted, an extension of the time-limit to supplement his appeal. In August 2004 he submitted his supplementary pleadings and, on 14 September 2004, the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal.","{'applicant': 'John Iselsten', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-89321
411,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 11320/05) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Swedish national, Mr John Iselsten (“the applicant”), on 11 March 2005.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr P.-O. Nordh, a lawyer practising in Vallentuna. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr B. Sjöberg, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

On 4 January 2007 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of an oral hearing before the Court of Appeal to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1932 and lives in Stockholm. He is a lawyer.

On 17 March 1997 he sued the Swedish State for damages before the District Court (tingsrätten) of Stockholm, claiming negligence in the administration of his bankruptcy. The applicant requested that the court render a declaratory judgment (fastställelsetalan), establishing that the State was liable for damage allegedly caused by negligence during the Enforcement Service’s administration of his bankruptcy in 1987/88.

The District Court, in June 1997, ordered the applicant to specify his claims and to elaborate further the grounds for these claims. Upon a request by the applicant, the court granted him an extension of the time-limit for submitting the supplementary material. On 20 August 1997, the court received the applicant’s submissions, which included 57 annexes.

On 29 October 1997 the District Court, without having issued a summons, rejected the applicant’s claim as being clearly unfounded.

The applicant appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal (hovrätten) and demanded that the case be remitted to the lower court for proper examination. The Court of Appeal, in June 1998, requested the applicant to supplement his appeal and to specify his claims. After having been granted an extension of the time-limit, the applicant complied with the request.

In a judgment of 17 December 1998, the Court of Appeal set aside the lower court’s judgment as far as the applicant’s claim relating to damage allegedly caused by the Enforcement Service’s administration of his bankruptcy was concerned and remitted the case to the District Court for proper examination. However, the Court of Appeal also decided not to allow the applicant to plead that the State was responsible for damage caused by an alleged breach of contract by the Enforcement Service.

The applicant appealed against the judgment to the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen), seeking leave to invoke the alleged breach of contract. On 23 April 1999, the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal.

The proceedings were then re-initiated before the District Court, which, in June 1999, issued a summons to the State, represented by the National Tax Board (Riksskatteverket). The State disputed the claims and the applicant was given the opportunity to comment on the State’s submissions. After having been granted two extensions of the time-limit due to ill-health, the applicant had his third such request for an extension rejected. The court called the parties to a preparatory meeting to be held on 18 January 2000. As the meeting could not be finalised in one day, it was resumed on 21 February 2000. The parties were subsequently requested to submit the evidence invoked. The applicant asked for, and was granted, another three extensions of the time-limit during the spring and summer before submitting all the requested material. During the autumn of 2000 both parties submitted comments relating to, inter alia, the oral evidence invoked and the schedule for the oral hearing. Due to the applicant’s health problems, the main hearing was eventually scheduled for 23 and 24 January 2001. During the hearing, four witnesses were heard and extensive written evidence was produced.

On 21 February 2001 the District Court rejected the applicant’s claim for damage as it did not find that the Enforcement Service’s administration of the bankruptcy had been negligent.

The applicant appealed against the judgment to the Court of Appeal, requesting that the case be remitted to the lower court or, in the alternative, that his claims be upheld. He further asked to be heard under oath (sanningsförsäkran) before the Court of Appeal and for the four witnesses to be heard again. The State submitted its reply to the applicant’s submissions on 6 August 2001.

On 30 December 2003 the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s request to have the case remitted to the District Court. It further refused to allow the applicant to invoke certain new evidence, and to be heard under oath, since he had not shown that he had a valid excuse for having failed to produce the evidence previously before the lower court. At the same time, the court informed the parties that it was considering adjudicating the case without holding an oral hearing. Thus, the parties were given the opportunity to state their view on this matter and to conclude their submissions. The State consented to the case being decided upon without a main hearing, whereas the applicant opposed it.

In a judgment of 10 June 2004, the Court of Appeal upheld the lower court’s judgment in full, noting that the parties had essentially invoked and developed the circumstances on which their claims were based in the same manner as before the District Court and that they had invoked written evidence. The Court of Appeal found no reason to depart from the evaluation of the case made by the lower court. As concerned its decision not to hold an oral hearing the court stated that, according to the relevant rules in the Code of Judicial Procedure, an appeal could always be adjudicated without a main hearing if it was clear that such a hearing was unnecessary. The court then considered that it was clear that a main hearing was unnecessary in the case before it in view of the investigation of the matter at hand. The fact that the applicant opposed the determination of the case without a hearing was immaterial as the issues of law raised in the case had been elucidated at the District Court in a way that made it obvious that a main hearing would not add anything of value to the case. Hence, the court found that there was no impediment to the case being adjudicated without a main hearing.

On 20 July 2004 the applicant’s appeal reached the Supreme Court and he asked for, and was granted, an extension of the time-limit to supplement his appeal. In August 2004 he submitted his supplementary pleadings and, on 14 September 2004, the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal.","{'applicant': 'John Iselsten', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-89321

413,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 34129/96) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Kudlip S. Sander (“the applicant”), on 22 July 1996.

The applicant was represented by Mr G. Henson, a barrister practising in London. The Government of the United Kingdom (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms S. Langrish, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant complained that his case had not been heard by an impartial tribunal because, allegedly, the jury had been racially prejudiced.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court).

By a decision of 29 June 1999, the Chamber declared the application partly admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed written observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

In March 1995 the applicant, an Asian, appeared together with J.B. and G.C. before the Birmingham Crown Court, composed of a judge and a jury, to be tried for conspiracy to defraud.

After the defence had stated its case, the judge started his summing‑up, which he had almost completed by Friday evening when he adjourned.

On Monday morning a juror arrived at the court and handed an envelope to the court usher containing the following complaint: “I have decided I cannot remain silent any longer. For some time during the trial I have been concerned that fellow jurors are not taking their duties seriously. At least two have been making openly racist remarks and jokes and I fear are going to convict the defendants not on the evidence but because they are Asian. My concern is the defendants will not therefore receive a fair verdict. Please could you advise me what I can do in this situation.”

The juror who had written the complaint was asked not to join the other jurors. The judge discussed the complaint with counsel in chambers and then adjourned and listened to submissions in open court. The defence asked the judge to dismiss the jury on the ground that there was a real danger of bias. The judge, however, decided to call the jury back into court, at which stage the juror who had written the complaint joined the others. The judge read out the complaint to them and told them the following: “Members of the jury, this morning I received a note from one of your number expressing extreme concern that some of your number are not taking your duties seriously, are making openly racist remarks and jokes about Asians and may not reach your verdicts upon the evidence but because of some racial prejudice. I am not able to conduct an inquiry into the validity of those contentions and I do not propose to do so. This case has cost an enormous amount of money and I am not anxious to halt it at the moment, but I shall have no compunction in doing so if the situation demands. When you took the oath or affirmed as jurors it was, you will remember, to bring in true verdicts according to the evidence. That is solemn and binding and means what it says. I am going to adjourn now and I am going to ask you all to search your conscience overnight and if you feel that you are not able to try this case solely on the evidence and find that you cannot put aside any prejudices you may have will you please indicate that fact by writing a personal note to that effect and giving it to the jury bailiff on your arrival at court tomorrow morning. I will then review the position. Thank you very much.”

The next morning the judge received two letters from the jury. The first letter, which was signed by all the jurors including the juror who had sent the complaint, stated the following: “We, the undersigned members of the jury, wish to put on record to the Court our response to yesterday's note from a juror implying possible racial bias.

We utterly refute the allegation.

We are deeply offended by the allegation.

We assure the Court that we intend to reach a verdict solely according to the evidence and without racial bias.”

The second letter, which the judge commended, was written by a juror who appeared to have thought himself to have been the one who had been making the jokes. The juror in question explained at length that he might have done so, that he was sorry if he had given any offence, that he was somebody who had many connections with people from ethnic minorities and that he was in no way racially biased.

The judge decided that he would not discharge the jury and told them the following: “Ladies and gentlemen, the events of yesterday afternoon were clearly distressing for you, but I am sure you will see and realise that when a judge receives a note from one of your number raising those sort of issues it is the judge's duty to bring it to the attention of the whole jury. Whether the suggestions were well or ill-founded is not something I or any judge can decide, nor is it something that can be investigated by the judge. It would be an improper activity. I took the course I did in the exercise of my discretion and I am sorry you were offended and upset. However, all twelve of you have this morning utterly refuted the allegation, expressed your deep offence at it and assured the Court that you intend to reach a verdict or verdicts solely according to the evidence and without racial bias. One of your number has also written at length a most cogent and balanced letter, and it is quite clear to me that each and every one of you are conscious of the oath or affirmation that you have taken and are dutifully prepared to abide by.”

On 8 March 1995 the jury found the applicant guilty, but acquitted G.C., who was also Asian. On 20 April 1995 the judge imposed on the applicant a sentence of five years' imprisonment.

The applicant was given leave to appeal against conviction. In his appeal he raised, inter alia, the following ground: The judge should have reacted to the juror's complaint by dismissing the jury; in any event, the juror who had written the complaint should not have been segregated from the other members of the jury in the early stages and the judge should not have disclosed to the jurors the contents of the complaint.

On 1 March 1996 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal. As regards the above-mentioned ground it considered the following: The court had regard to the letter signed by all the members of the jury, and the letter of the juror who was probably responsible for the remarks that had given offence, and found that the trial judge did not err in reaching the conclusion that there was no real risk of bias. Moreover, the judge was right to confront the jury with the problem and ask them to consider it. It was perhaps unfortunate that the juror who had written the complaint was for a time segregated from the other members of the jury, as this led to his identification. However, it would be unrealistic to suppose that the jury would not have wanted to know who the author of the complaint was and the judge dealt with the possibility of tensions among the jurors perfectly sensibly in the direction he gave to them.","{'applicant': 'Kudlip S.

I took the course I did in the exercise of my discretion and I am sorry you were offended and upset. However, all twelve of you have this morning utterly refuted the allegation, expressed your deep offence at it and assured the Court that you intend to reach a verdict or verdicts solely according to the evidence and without racial bias. One of your number has also written at length a most cogent and balanced letter, and it is quite clear to me that each and every one of you are conscious of the oath or affirmation that you have taken and are dutifully prepared to abide by.”

On 8 March 1995 the jury found the applicant guilty, but acquitted G.C., who was also Asian. On 20 April 1995 the judge imposed on the applicant a sentence of five years' imprisonment.

The applicant was given leave to appeal against conviction. In his appeal he raised, inter alia, the following ground: The judge should have reacted to the juror's complaint by dismissing the jury; in any event, the juror who had written the complaint should not have been segregated from the other members of the jury in the early stages and the judge should not have disclosed to the jurors the contents of the complaint.

On 1 March 1996 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal. As regards the above-mentioned ground it considered the following: The court had regard to the letter signed by all the members of the jury, and the letter of the juror who was probably responsible for the remarks that had given offence, and found that the trial judge did not err in reaching the conclusion that there was no real risk of bias. Moreover, the judge was right to confront the jury with the problem and ask them to consider it. It was perhaps unfortunate that the juror who had written the complaint was for a time segregated from the other members of the jury, as this led to his identification. However, it would be unrealistic to suppose that the jury would not have wanted to know who the author of the complaint was and the judge dealt with the possibility of tensions among the jurors perfectly sensibly in the direction he gave to them.","{'applicant': 'Kudlip S.

The case originated in an application (no. 34129/96) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Kudlip S. Sander (“the applicant”), on 22 July 1996.

The applicant was represented by Mr G. Henson, a barrister practising in London. The Government of the United Kingdom (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms S. Langrish, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant complained that his case had not been heard by an impartial tribunal because, allegedly, the jury had been racially prejudiced.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court).

By a decision of 29 June 1999, the Chamber declared the application partly admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed written observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

In March 1995 the applicant, an Asian, appeared together with J.B. and G.C. before the Birmingham Crown Court, composed of a judge and a jury, to be tried for conspiracy to defraud.

After the defence had stated its case, the judge started his summing‑up, which he had almost completed by Friday evening when he adjourned.

On Monday morning a juror arrived at the court and handed an envelope to the court usher containing the following complaint: “I have decided I cannot remain silent any longer. For some time during the trial I have been concerned that fellow jurors are not taking their duties seriously. At least two have been making openly racist remarks and jokes and I fear are going to convict the defendants not on the evidence but because they are Asian. My concern is the defendants will not therefore receive a fair verdict. Please could you advise me what I can do in this situation.”

The juror who had written the complaint was asked not to join the other jurors. The judge discussed the complaint with counsel in chambers and then adjourned and listened to submissions in open court. The defence asked the judge to dismiss the jury on the ground that there was a real danger of bias. The judge, however, decided to call the jury back into court, at which stage the juror who had written the complaint joined the others. The judge read out the complaint to them and told them the following: “Members of the jury, this morning I received a note from one of your number expressing extreme concern that some of your number are not taking your duties seriously, are making openly racist remarks and jokes about Asians and may not reach your verdicts upon the evidence but because of some racial prejudice. I am not able to conduct an inquiry into the validity of those contentions and I do not propose to do so. This case has cost an enormous amount of money and I am not anxious to halt it at the moment, but I shall have no compunction in doing so if the situation demands. When you took the oath or affirmed as jurors it was, you will remember, to bring in true verdicts according to the evidence. That is solemn and binding and means what it says. I am going to adjourn now and I am going to ask you all to search your conscience overnight and if you feel that you are not able to try this case solely on the evidence and find that you cannot put aside any prejudices you may have will you please indicate that fact by writing a personal note to that effect and giving it to the jury bailiff on your arrival at court tomorrow morning. I will then review the position. Thank you very much.”

The next morning the judge received two letters from the jury. The first letter, which was signed by all the jurors including the juror who had sent the complaint, stated the following: “We, the undersigned members of the jury, wish to put on record to the Court our response to yesterday's note from a juror implying possible racial bias.

We utterly refute the allegation.

We are deeply offended by the allegation.

We assure the Court that we intend to reach a verdict solely according to the evidence and without racial bias.”

The second letter, which the judge commended, was written by a juror who appeared to have thought himself to have been the one who had been making the jokes. The juror in question explained at length that he might have done so, that he was sorry if he had given any offence, that he was somebody who had many connections with people from ethnic minorities and that he was in no way racially biased.

The judge decided that he would not discharge the jury and told them the following: “Ladies and gentlemen, the events of yesterday afternoon were clearly distressing for you, but I am sure you will see and realise that when a judge receives a note from one of your number raising those sort of issues it is the judge's duty to bring it to the attention of the whole jury. Whether the suggestions were well or ill-founded is not something I or any judge can decide, nor is it something that can be investigated by the judge. It would be an improper activity.

418,"PROCEDURE

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 21 February 1992, within the three-month period laid down in Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention“). It originated in two applications against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (nos. 14553-14554/89) both lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 19 January 1989 by Irish citizens, Mr Peter Brannigan and Mr Patrick McBride. Mr McBride subsequently died in 1992 (see paragraph 11 below). The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether or not the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the United Kingdom of its obligations under Article 5 paras. 3 and 5 and Article 13 (art. 5-3, art. 5-5, art. 13), in the light of the United Kingdom’s derogation under Article 15 (art. 15).

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, Mr Brannigan and Mrs McBride - Mr McBride’s mother and personal representative (see paragraph 11 below) - stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent them (Rule 30). For reasons of convenience Mr McBride will continue to be referred to in this judgment as the applicant. The Irish Government, having been informed by the Registrar of its right to intervene in the proceedings (Article 48, sub-paragraph (b), of the Convention and Rule 33 para. 3 (b)) (art. 48-b), did not indicate any intention of so doing.

The Chamber to be constituted included, ex officio, Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 27 February 1992, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr R. Bernhardt, Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr B. Walsh, Mr S.K. Martens, Mr R. Pekkanen and Mr L. Wildhaber (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 23) (art. 43).

Mr Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5) and, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government of the United Kingdom (“the Government“), the Delegate of the Commission and the representatives of the applicants on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). In accordance with the President’s orders and directions, the Registrar received, on 17 July 1992, the memorial of the Government. The applicants’ memorial was filed out-of-time on 31 August 1992. However, on 28 October 1992, the Chamber decided that it should be regarded as part of the case file (Rule 37 para. 1 in fine). The Secretary to the Commission had previously informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.

On 27 March, the President had granted, under Rule 37 para. 2, leave to the Northern Ireland Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights to submit written comments on specific aspects of the case. Leave was also granted on 27 May, subject to certain conditions, to Amnesty International and three organisations which had made a joint request, namely Liberty, Interights and the Committee on the Administration of Justice. The respective comments were received on 22 June, 7 and 19 August 1992.

On 28 October 1992 the Chamber decided, pursuant to Rule 51, to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court.

As directed by the President, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 24 November 1992. There appeared before the Court:

for the Government Mrs A. Glover, Legal Counsellor, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr N. Bratza, Q.C., Mr R. Weatherup, Counsel;

for the Commission Mr H. Danelius, Delegate;

for the applicants Mr R. Weir, Q.C., Mr S. Treacy, Barrister-at-law, Counsel, Mr P. Madden, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr Bratza for the Government, by Mr Danelius for the Commission and by Mr Weir for the applicants, as well as replies to questions put by two of its members individually.

Prior to the hearing the Government were granted permission by the President to file comments on certain aspects of the observations made by the amici curiae. The applicants’ written comments on these submissions were received on 18 December 1992. The Government’s observations on the applicants’ Article 50 (art. 50) claims were submitted on 17 January 1993.

Mr B. Repik, who had attended the hearing and taken part in the deliberations of 26 November 1992, was unable to sit in the present case after 31 December 1992, his term of office having come to an end owing to the dissolution of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (Articles 38 and 65 para. 3 of the Convention) (art. 38, art. 65-3).

AS TO THE FACTS

I. THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

A. Peter Brannigan

The first applicant, Mr Peter Brannigan, was born in 1964. He is a labourer and lives in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland. He was arrested at his home by police officers on 9 January 1989 at 6.30 a.m. pursuant to section 12 (1) (b) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1984 (“the 1984 Act“). He was then removed to the Interrogation Centre at Gough Barracks, Armagh, where he was served with a copy of the “Notice to Persons in Police Custody“ which informs the prisoner of his legal rights (see paragraph 24 below). A two-day extension of his detention was granted by the Secretary of State on 10 January 1989 at 7.30 p.m., and a further three-day extension was granted on 12 January 1989 at 9.32 p.m. He was released at 9 p.m. on 15 January 1989. He was therefore detained for a total period of six days, fourteen hours and thirty minutes. During his detention he was interrogated on forty-three occasions and denied access to books, newspapers and writing materials as well radio and television. He was not allowed to associate with other prisoners. Although access to a solicitor was at first delayed for forty- eight hours because it was believed by the police that such a visit would interfere with the investigation, the first applicant was subsequently visited by his solicitor on 11 January 1989. He was seen by a medical practitioner on seventeen occasions during police custody.

B. Patrick McBride

The second applicant, Mr Patrick McBride, was born in 1951. He was arrested at his home by police officers on 5 January 1989 at 5.05 a.m. pursuant to section 12 (1) (b) of the 1984 Act. He was then removed to Castlereagh Interrogation Centre where he was served with a copy of the “Notice to Persons in Police Custody“. A three-day extension of his period of detention was granted by the Secretary of State at 5.10 p.m. on 6 January 1989. He was released at 11.30 a.m. on Monday 9 January 1989. He was therefore detained for a total period of four days, six hours and twenty-five minutes. During his detention he was interrogated on twenty-two occasions and was subject to the same regime as Mr Brannigan (see paragraph 10 above). He received two visits from his solicitor on 5 and 7 January 1989 and was seen by a medical practitioner on eight occasions during police custody. Mr McBride was shot dead on 4 February 1992 by a policeman who had run amok and attacked Sinn Fein Headquarters in Belfast.","{'applicant': 'Peter Brannigan', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 53, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1993}",001-57819

The second applicant, Mr Patrick McBride, was born in 1951. He was arrested at his home by police officers on 5 January 1989 at 5.05 a.m. pursuant to section 12 (1) (b) of the 1984 Act. He was then removed to Castlereagh Interrogation Centre where he was served with a copy of the “Notice to Persons in Police Custody“. A three-day extension of his period of detention was granted by the Secretary of State at 5.10 p.m. on 6 January 1989. He was released at 11.30 a.m. on Monday 9 January 1989. He was therefore detained for a total period of four days, six hours and twenty-five minutes. During his detention he was interrogated on twenty-two occasions and was subject to the same regime as Mr Brannigan (see paragraph 10 above). He received two visits from his solicitor on 5 and 7 January 1989 and was seen by a medical practitioner on eight occasions during police custody. Mr McBride was shot dead on 4 February 1992 by a policeman who had run amok and attacked Sinn Fein Headquarters in Belfast.","{'applicant': 'Peter Brannigan', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 53, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1993}",001-57819

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 21 February 1992, within the three-month period laid down in Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention“). It originated in two applications against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (nos. 14553-14554/89) both lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 19 January 1989 by Irish citizens, Mr Peter Brannigan and Mr Patrick McBride. Mr McBride subsequently died in 1992 (see paragraph 11 below). The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether or not the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the United Kingdom of its obligations under Article 5 paras. 3 and 5 and Article 13 (art. 5-3, art. 5-5, art. 13), in the light of the United Kingdom’s derogation under Article 15 (art. 15).

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, Mr Brannigan and Mrs McBride - Mr McBride’s mother and personal representative (see paragraph 11 below) - stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent them (Rule 30). For reasons of convenience Mr McBride will continue to be referred to in this judgment as the applicant. The Irish Government, having been informed by the Registrar of its right to intervene in the proceedings (Article 48, sub-paragraph (b), of the Convention and Rule 33 para. 3 (b)) (art. 48-b), did not indicate any intention of so doing.

The Chamber to be constituted included, ex officio, Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 27 February 1992, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr R. Bernhardt, Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr B. Walsh, Mr S.K. Martens, Mr R. Pekkanen and Mr L. Wildhaber (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 23) (art. 43).

Mr Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5) and, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government of the United Kingdom (“the Government“), the Delegate of the Commission and the representatives of the applicants on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). In accordance with the President’s orders and directions, the Registrar received, on 17 July 1992, the memorial of the Government. The applicants’ memorial was filed out-of-time on 31 August 1992. However, on 28 October 1992, the Chamber decided that it should be regarded as part of the case file (Rule 37 para. 1 in fine). The Secretary to the Commission had previously informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.

On 27 March, the President had granted, under Rule 37 para. 2, leave to the Northern Ireland Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights to submit written comments on specific aspects of the case. Leave was also granted on 27 May, subject to certain conditions, to Amnesty International and three organisations which had made a joint request, namely Liberty, Interights and the Committee on the Administration of Justice. The respective comments were received on 22 June, 7 and 19 August 1992.

On 28 October 1992 the Chamber decided, pursuant to Rule 51, to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court.

As directed by the President, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 24 November 1992. There appeared before the Court:

for the Government Mrs A. Glover, Legal Counsellor, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr N. Bratza, Q.C., Mr R. Weatherup, Counsel;

for the Commission Mr H. Danelius, Delegate;

for the applicants Mr R. Weir, Q.C., Mr S. Treacy, Barrister-at-law, Counsel, Mr P. Madden, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr Bratza for the Government, by Mr Danelius for the Commission and by Mr Weir for the applicants, as well as replies to questions put by two of its members individually.

Prior to the hearing the Government were granted permission by the President to file comments on certain aspects of the observations made by the amici curiae. The applicants’ written comments on these submissions were received on 18 December 1992. The Government’s observations on the applicants’ Article 50 (art. 50) claims were submitted on 17 January 1993.

Mr B. Repik, who had attended the hearing and taken part in the deliberations of 26 November 1992, was unable to sit in the present case after 31 December 1992, his term of office having come to an end owing to the dissolution of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (Articles 38 and 65 para. 3 of the Convention) (art. 38, art. 65-3).

AS TO THE FACTS

I. THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

A. Peter Brannigan

The first applicant, Mr Peter Brannigan, was born in 1964. He is a labourer and lives in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland. He was arrested at his home by police officers on 9 January 1989 at 6.30 a.m. pursuant to section 12 (1) (b) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1984 (“the 1984 Act“). He was then removed to the Interrogation Centre at Gough Barracks, Armagh, where he was served with a copy of the “Notice to Persons in Police Custody“ which informs the prisoner of his legal rights (see paragraph 24 below). A two-day extension of his detention was granted by the Secretary of State on 10 January 1989 at 7.30 p.m., and a further three-day extension was granted on 12 January 1989 at 9.32 p.m. He was released at 9 p.m. on 15 January 1989. He was therefore detained for a total period of six days, fourteen hours and thirty minutes. During his detention he was interrogated on forty-three occasions and denied access to books, newspapers and writing materials as well radio and television. He was not allowed to associate with other prisoners. Although access to a solicitor was at first delayed for forty- eight hours because it was believed by the police that such a visit would interfere with the investigation, the first applicant was subsequently visited by his solicitor on 11 January 1989. He was seen by a medical practitioner on seventeen occasions during police custody.

B. Patrick McBride

The second applicant, Mr Patrick McBride, was born in 1951. He was arrested at his home by police officers on 5 January 1989 at 5.05 a.m. pursuant to section 12 (1) (b) of the 1984 Act. He was then removed to Castlereagh Interrogation Centre where he was served with a copy of the “Notice to Persons in Police Custody“.

422,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 50034/99) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Olubukunola Obasa (“the applicant”), on 30 April 1999.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Pedro Emmanuel Solicitors, lawyers practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Grainger of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant alleged that the proceedings in which she claimed discrimination at work took an unreasonable length of time contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

On 30 November 2000, the Court declared part of the application inadmissible and adjourned examination of the complaints relating to length of proceedings.

On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section. By a decision of 15 November 2001, the Court declared the remainder of the application admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations concerning the issue of just satisfaction. The Court decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine).

THE FACTS

The applicant, Olubukunola Obasa, is a United Kingdom national, who was born in 1961 and lives in Wellingborough.

The applicant commenced employment as a social worker with the London Borough of Islington (“the Council”) on 4 September 1989. In April 1991, she submitted a formal complaint to the Council's principal Equal Opportunities Officers alleging inter alia harassment and refusal of a promotion on grounds of race. She was interviewed by investigating officers in October 1991.

On 9 December 1991, the applicant presented an originating application to the Employment Tribunal alleging that she had been discriminated against as a black woman with a disability, inter alia, due to the decision to give a promotion to another employee instead of herself, the failure to transfer her to another post and the failure to assign her to a higher grade by giving due recognition to her professional qualifications. In her application, she relied on events going back to the commencement of her employment in 1989.

On 23 January 1992, one of the Council's investigating officers informed the applicant that her complaints had been found to be unsubstantiated. The applicant sought to appeal the rejection of her complaints pursuant to the Council's internal grievance procedure.

The Employment Tribunal held a hearing on 9 June 1992, at which the parties agreed that under section 68(1) of the Race Relations Act 1976, which required that complaints be presented within three months of the act complained of, the applicant could not rely upon events taking place before September 1990. Determination of the merits was considered to require detailed evidence and the matter was reserved for a further hearing.

On 24 June 1992, the Council made a request for further and better particulars of the originating application. The applicant replied on 24 November 1992.

While in the ordinary course of events the hearing on the merits would have been listed for hearing in the first half of 1993, the Council applied to the Employment Tribunal for the merits hearing to be postponed, on the grounds that it would be preferable to await the outcome of the applicant's internal appeal. The matter was adjourned, the applicant making no objection to this adjournment.

The applicant's internal appeal was heard by the Council on 28 April and 4 May 1993. By letter dated 13 May 1993, she was informed that her appeal had been rejected. However, with regard to the applicant's transfer request, the Council committee was concerned at the lack of evidence that any serious consideration was given to this matter and expressed the view that steps should be taken to find the applicant alternative work and to expedite her transfer. Pursuant to this decision, instructions were given to investigate options for a transfer. An offer of transfer was made to the applicant on 8 February 1994.

Following the determination of the internal appeal, the Tribunal resumed consideration of the applicant's case, listing the case for a merits hearing on 11-13 May 1994. The case lasted longer than anticipated by the parties and it was adjourned and re-listed. The Council had indicated to the Tribunal on 13 May that it would be possible to reach a negotiated settlement. In the event a settlement was not reached and the Tribunal re-convened on 7 November 1994 for a further four days.

On 20 December 1994, the Tribunal issued its decision, finding that there had been discrimination by her employer in a number of procedural aspects.

The proceedings were adjourned for the parties to reach agreement as to the damages payable. The Council had already met with the applicant's trade union representatives on 6 December 1994. Negotiations culminated in a meeting of 24 March 1995, in which the Council's legal representatives agreed a settlement figure with the applicant subject to the approval of the elected members of the Council. On 3 April 1995, the Council informed the applicant that their members had rejected their officers' recommendations and that no settlement was possible on the terms discussed. The applicant broke off the negotiations entirely the next day.

The Tribunal proposed listing the case in June 1995 but as these dates were not convenient for the Council and it appears that the applicant was not available in June 1995 the date was fixed for 11 September 1995. After a remedies hearing on that date, the Tribunal made the applicant an award of 24,952.51 pounds sterling (GBP), which decision issued on 9 October 1995.

The Council appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal (“EAT”). Its notice of appeal had been lodged on 27 January 1995, as it was required to be lodged within 42 days of the merits decision.

On 3 October 1995, an ex parte preliminary hearing was held by the EAT to determine whether the appeal had reasonable prospects of success. It ordered that the appeal should proceed to a full hearing and required the Employment Tribunal's notes of evidence to be disclosed. These consisted of some 50 pages. After their transcription, the EAT sent out a listing notice on 11 July 1996, giving a hearing date of 17 September 1996.

After the hearing, the EAT delivered judgment on 28 October 1996. It quashed the findings of discrimination.

On 12 December 1996, the applicant filed an application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Permission was granted by the Court of Appeal on 3 February 1997. The applicant lodged her notice of appeal on 11 February 1997. The bundles of documents were filed on 21 May 1997.

After a hearing, on 16 February 1998 at which the applicant was represented, the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's appeal.

The Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords on 19 March 1998.

On 27 March 1998, the applicant sought leave to appeal to the House of Lords. In her petition, she requested exemption under House of Lords Standing Order XIII from the lodgement fee as she was no longer in receipt of legal aid. In July 1998, the Appeal Committee of the House of Lords decided to waive the fee. The petition was then formally lodged in July 1998. The applicant supplied the transcripts necessary for the application on 30 November 1998. The House of Lords refused leave on 26 April 1999.","{'applicant': 'Olubukunola Obasa', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2003}",001-60886

The Tribunal proposed listing the case in June 1995 but as these dates were not convenient for the Council and it appears that the applicant was not available in June 1995 the date was fixed for 11 September 1995. After a remedies hearing on that date, the Tribunal made the applicant an award of 24,952.51 pounds sterling (GBP), which decision issued on 9 October 1995.

The Council appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal (“EAT”). Its notice of appeal had been lodged on 27 January 1995, as it was required to be lodged within 42 days of the merits decision.

On 3 October 1995, an ex parte preliminary hearing was held by the EAT to determine whether the appeal had reasonable prospects of success. It ordered that the appeal should proceed to a full hearing and required the Employment Tribunal's notes of evidence to be disclosed. These consisted of some 50 pages. After their transcription, the EAT sent out a listing notice on 11 July 1996, giving a hearing date of 17 September 1996.

After the hearing, the EAT delivered judgment on 28 October 1996. It quashed the findings of discrimination.

On 12 December 1996, the applicant filed an application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Permission was granted by the Court of Appeal on 3 February 1997. The applicant lodged her notice of appeal on 11 February 1997. The bundles of documents were filed on 21 May 1997.

After a hearing, on 16 February 1998 at which the applicant was represented, the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's appeal.

The Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords on 19 March 1998.

On 27 March 1998, the applicant sought leave to appeal to the House of Lords. In her petition, she requested exemption under House of Lords Standing Order XIII from the lodgement fee as she was no longer in receipt of legal aid. In July 1998, the Appeal Committee of the House of Lords decided to waive the fee. The petition was then formally lodged in July 1998. The applicant supplied the transcripts necessary for the application on 30 November 1998. The House of Lords refused leave on 26 April 1999.","{'applicant': 'Olubukunola Obasa', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2003}",001-60886
424,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 50034/99) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Olubukunola Obasa (“the applicant”), on 30 April 1999.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Pedro Emmanuel Solicitors, lawyers practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Grainger of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant alleged that the proceedings in which she claimed discrimination at work took an unreasonable length of time contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

On 30 November 2000, the Court declared part of the application inadmissible and adjourned examination of the complaints relating to length of proceedings.

On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section. By a decision of 15 November 2001, the Court declared the remainder of the application admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations concerning the issue of just satisfaction. The Court decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine).

THE FACTS

The applicant, Olubukunola Obasa, is a United Kingdom national, who was born in 1961 and lives in Wellingborough.

The applicant commenced employment as a social worker with the London Borough of Islington (“the Council”) on 4 September 1989. In April 1991, she submitted a formal complaint to the Council's principal Equal Opportunities Officers alleging inter alia harassment and refusal of a promotion on grounds of race. She was interviewed by investigating officers in October 1991.

On 9 December 1991, the applicant presented an originating application to the Employment Tribunal alleging that she had been discriminated against as a black woman with a disability, inter alia, due to the decision to give a promotion to another employee instead of herself, the failure to transfer her to another post and the failure to assign her to a higher grade by giving due recognition to her professional qualifications. In her application, she relied on events going back to the commencement of her employment in 1989.

On 23 January 1992, one of the Council's investigating officers informed the applicant that her complaints had been found to be unsubstantiated. The applicant sought to appeal the rejection of her complaints pursuant to the Council's internal grievance procedure.

The Employment Tribunal held a hearing on 9 June 1992, at which the parties agreed that under section 68(1) of the Race Relations Act 1976, which required that complaints be presented within three months of the act complained of, the applicant could not rely upon events taking place before September 1990. Determination of the merits was considered to require detailed evidence and the matter was reserved for a further hearing.

On 24 June 1992, the Council made a request for further and better particulars of the originating application. The applicant replied on 24 November 1992.

While in the ordinary course of events the hearing on the merits would have been listed for hearing in the first half of 1993, the Council applied to the Employment Tribunal for the merits hearing to be postponed, on the grounds that it would be preferable to await the outcome of the applicant's internal appeal. The matter was adjourned, the applicant making no objection to this adjournment.

The applicant's internal appeal was heard by the Council on 28 April and 4 May 1993. By letter dated 13 May 1993, she was informed that her appeal had been rejected. However, with regard to the applicant's transfer request, the Council committee was concerned at the lack of evidence that any serious consideration was given to this matter and expressed the view that steps should be taken to find the applicant alternative work and to expedite her transfer. Pursuant to this decision, instructions were given to investigate options for a transfer. An offer of transfer was made to the applicant on 8 February 1994.

Following the determination of the internal appeal, the Tribunal resumed consideration of the applicant's case, listing the case for a merits hearing on 11-13 May 1994. The case lasted longer than anticipated by the parties and it was adjourned and re-listed. The Council had indicated to the Tribunal on 13 May that it would be possible to reach a negotiated settlement. In the event a settlement was not reached and the Tribunal re-convened on 7 November 1994 for a further four days.

On 20 December 1994, the Tribunal issued its decision, finding that there had been discrimination by her employer in a number of procedural aspects.

The proceedings were adjourned for the parties to reach agreement as to the damages payable. The Council had already met with the applicant's trade union representatives on 6 December 1994. Negotiations culminated in a meeting of 24 March 1995, in which the Council's legal representatives agreed a settlement figure with the applicant subject to the approval of the elected members of the Council. On 3 April 1995, the Council informed the applicant that their members had rejected their officers' recommendations and that no settlement was possible on the terms discussed. The applicant broke off the negotiations entirely the next day.

The Tribunal proposed listing the case in June 1995 but as these dates were not convenient for the Council and it appears that the applicant was not available in June 1995 the date was fixed for 11 September 1995.

The case originated in an application (no. 8693/11) against the Kingdom of Denmark lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Danish national, Mr Henrik Mønsted Jensen (“the applicant”), on 22 October 2010.

The applicant was represented by Mr Peter Trudsø, a lawyer practising in Copenhagen. The Danish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their former Agent, Mr Jonas Bering Liisberg, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and their Co-agent, Mrs Nina Holst‑Christensen, from the Ministry of Justice.

The applicant alleged that the dismissal of his appeal to the High Court breached his right to a fair trial as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention.

On 3 July 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Skørping.

By an indictment of 25 October 2007 the applicant, jointly with three co‑accused, was charged with violation of intellectual property rights under section 299 b of the Penal Code of a particularly aggravated nature, comprising professionally organised production, importation and sales, in which the defendants had cooperated on marketing substantial quantities of counterfeit goods in the form of designer knives, lamps and similar products.

From the beginning of 2006 the applicant was represented by lawyer A, and as from 21 August 2009, the applicant was represented by lawyer B.

By letters of 1 and 9 September 2009 A submitted his claim for legal costs to the City Court for work performed from 2006 until 2009. By decision of 24 September 2009 the City Court granted A fees in the amount of DKK 183,862.50 (approximately EUR 24,700) plus VAT and reimbursement of costs in the amount of DKK 2,060 which was provisionally to be paid by the Treasury. It appears that the transcript of the court records was sent to counsel A and the prosecutor in accordance with usual practice. Neither the applicant nor B was informed of this decision.

The case was heard before the City Court (Retten i Viborg) over 15 days between 24 September and 4 December 2009.

By a judgment of 4 December 2009, the City Court convicted the applicant and the three co-accused. The applicant was convicted on two out of fifteen counts and given a six months’ suspended sentence, and 120 hours of community service due to his good personal circumstances and the fact that his role had been a minor one. In addition the proceeds, estimated at 40,000 Danish Kroner (DKK), were confiscated, as were various copies of designer goods, such as lamps and cutlery. The applicant and B were present when the judgment was passed. The operative part of the judgment, including the matter of payment of legal costs, was read aloud when the judgment was passed.

A few days later lawyer B received a transcript of the judgment, which in the operative part relating to legal fees stated: “Each of the accused is to pay the legal costs relating to them, including the fee to counsel appointed to them.”

The applicant did not appeal against the judgment to the High Court, nor did the public prosecution.

According to a court record of 5 January 2010, the City Court approved the costs to be paid to B in the amount of DKK 247,200 (approximately EUR 33,200) plus VAT and reimbursement of other costs amounting to DKK 32,423. It was stated that the amount was to be paid by the applicant.

On 17 January 2010, on behalf of the applicant, B appealed against the decision. He did not contest the amount granted, but claimed that it should be paid entirely or partly by the Treasury. In support thereof, and with reference to section 1008, section 2, of the Administration of Justice Act, he submitted that the applicant had only played a minor role in the criminal case; that an extensive part of the production of evidence did not relate to him; that he had been acquitted of one count; and that the total fee was of a significant amount.

On 25 January 2010, the applicant received an invoice from the police, dated 19 January 2010, requesting him to pay legal costs in the amount of DKK 573,311 (approximately EUR 77,000) including A’s and B’s fees. This was the moment when the applicant became aware for the first time of the fees that had been granted to A.

On 26 January 2010, on behalf of the applicant, B extended his appeal of 17 January 2010 also to include the payment of costs to A, which in the applicant’s view should be paid entirely or partly by the Treasury. He also requested that the City Court send him the court records of the decision to grant fees to A.

On 8 February 2010 the City Court submitted a letter to B, with which was enclosed a copy of the judgment of 4 December 2009, which on 5 February 2010 had been rectified on page 90 in the operative part as follows: “The accused are to pay the legal costs, so that each of them pays the legal costs relating to them, including the fees for their appointed counsel.”

The court records of 24 September 2009 and A’s letters of 1 and 9 September 2009 were also enclosed with the letter.

By letter of 11 February 2010, B informed the High Court of Western Denmark that the applicant withdrew his appeal as regards the fees to be paid to B. Moreover, he requested permission to submit further observations as regards the fee that the applicant had been ordered to pay to A.

In a supplementary pleading of 4 March 2010, B maintained that A’s fees should be paid by the Treasury. He pointed out that the fees payable to A and B totalled DKK 573,311 and that therefore the payment duty would be manifestly disproportionate to the applicant’s responsibility and circumstances. Referring to section 1008, subsection 4, of the Administration of Justice Act, he thus requested that the payment duty be reduced. In his view, the time-limit for appealing against the decisions on the fees to be paid to A should, at the earliest, run from 25 January 2010, the date on which the applicant received the invoice from the police and thus became aware for the first time of the fees that had been granted to A.

By decision of 10 March 2010 the High Court dismissed the appeal as being lodged out of time. More specifically, it stated: “The interlocutory appeal does not concern the amount of the fee granted to the applicant’s two defence lawyers; it only concerns the City Court’s decision that the applicant must pay the legal costs relating to him, including the fee to his appointed counsel. This decision was integrated in the judgment of 4 December 2009 and the applicant, who was present when the judgment was passed, was informed of the decision during that hearing. Accordingly, the time-limit must be calculated from 4 December 2009, pursuant to section 969 of the Administration Act, even if the applicant only later learned how much the legal costs, including the fees for the defence counsel, amounted to. Thus, the time-limit had expired when the interlocutory appeal was lodged on 17 January 2010.”

Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was refused by the Appeals Permission Board on 18 June 2010.","{'applicant': 'Henrik Mønsted Jensen', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'DNK', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2016}",001-169481

The case originated in an application (no. 8693/11) against the Kingdom of Denmark lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Danish national, Mr Henrik Mønsted Jensen (“the applicant”), on 22 October 2010.

The applicant was represented by Mr Peter Trudsø, a lawyer practising in Copenhagen. The Danish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their former Agent, Mr Jonas Bering Liisberg, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and their Co-agent, Mrs Nina Holst‑Christensen, from the Ministry of Justice.

The applicant alleged that the dismissal of his appeal to the High Court breached his right to a fair trial as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention.

On 3 July 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Skørping.

By an indictment of 25 October 2007 the applicant, jointly with three co‑accused, was charged with violation of intellectual property rights under section 299 b of the Penal Code of a particularly aggravated nature, comprising professionally organised production, importation and sales, in which the defendants had cooperated on marketing substantial quantities of counterfeit goods in the form of designer knives, lamps and similar products.

From the beginning of 2006 the applicant was represented by lawyer A, and as from 21 August 2009, the applicant was represented by lawyer B.

By letters of 1 and 9 September 2009 A submitted his claim for legal costs to the City Court for work performed from 2006 until 2009. By decision of 24 September 2009 the City Court granted A fees in the amount of DKK 183,862.50 (approximately EUR 24,700) plus VAT and reimbursement of costs in the amount of DKK 2,060 which was provisionally to be paid by the Treasury. It appears that the transcript of the court records was sent to counsel A and the prosecutor in accordance with usual practice. Neither the applicant nor B was informed of this decision.

The case was heard before the City Court (Retten i Viborg) over 15 days between 24 September and 4 December 2009.

By a judgment of 4 December 2009, the City Court convicted the applicant and the three co-accused. The applicant was convicted on two out of fifteen counts and given a six months’ suspended sentence, and 120 hours of community service due to his good personal circumstances and the fact that his role had been a minor one. In addition the proceeds, estimated at 40,000 Danish Kroner (DKK), were confiscated, as were various copies of designer goods, such as lamps and cutlery. The applicant and B were present when the judgment was passed. The operative part of the judgment, including the matter of payment of legal costs, was read aloud when the judgment was passed.

A few days later lawyer B received a transcript of the judgment, which in the operative part relating to legal fees stated: “Each of the accused is to pay the legal costs relating to them, including the fee to counsel appointed to them.”

The applicant did not appeal against the judgment to the High Court, nor did the public prosecution.

According to a court record of 5 January 2010, the City Court approved the costs to be paid to B in the amount of DKK 247,200 (approximately EUR 33,200) plus VAT and reimbursement of other costs amounting to DKK 32,423. It was stated that the amount was to be paid by the applicant.

On 17 January 2010, on behalf of the applicant, B appealed against the decision. He did not contest the amount granted, but claimed that it should be paid entirely or partly by the Treasury. In support thereof, and with reference to section 1008, section 2, of the Administration of Justice Act, he submitted that the applicant had only played a minor role in the criminal case; that an extensive part of the production of evidence did not relate to him; that he had been acquitted of one count; and that the total fee was of a significant amount.

On 25 January 2010, the applicant received an invoice from the police, dated 19 January 2010, requesting him to pay legal costs in the amount of DKK 573,311 (approximately EUR 77,000) including A’s and B’s fees. This was the moment when the applicant became aware for the first time of the fees that had been granted to A.

On 26 January 2010, on behalf of the applicant, B extended his appeal of 17 January 2010 also to include the payment of costs to A, which in the applicant’s view should be paid entirely or partly by the Treasury. He also requested that the City Court send him the court records of the decision to grant fees to A.

On 8 February 2010 the City Court submitted a letter to B, with which was enclosed a copy of the judgment of 4 December 2009, which on 5 February 2010 had been rectified on page 90 in the operative part as follows: “The accused are to pay the legal costs, so that each of them pays the legal costs relating to them, including the fees for their appointed counsel.”

The court records of 24 September 2009 and A’s letters of 1 and 9 September 2009 were also enclosed with the letter.

By letter of 11 February 2010, B informed the High Court of Western Denmark that the applicant withdrew his appeal as regards the fees to be paid to B. Moreover, he requested permission to submit further observations as regards the fee that the applicant had been ordered to pay to A.

In a supplementary pleading of 4 March 2010, B maintained that A’s fees should be paid by the Treasury. He pointed out that the fees payable to A and B totalled DKK 573,311 and that therefore the payment duty would be manifestly disproportionate to the applicant’s responsibility and circumstances. Referring to section 1008, subsection 4, of the Administration of Justice Act, he thus requested that the payment duty be reduced. In his view, the time-limit for appealing against the decisions on the fees to be paid to A should, at the earliest, run from 25 January 2010, the date on which the applicant received the invoice from the police and thus became aware for the first time of the fees that had been granted to A.

By decision of 10 March 2010 the High Court dismissed the appeal as being lodged out of time. More specifically, it stated: “The interlocutory appeal does not concern the amount of the fee granted to the applicant’s two defence lawyers; it only concerns the City Court’s decision that the applicant must pay the legal costs relating to him, including the fee to his appointed counsel. This decision was integrated in the judgment of 4 December 2009 and the applicant, who was present when the judgment was passed, was informed of the decision during that hearing. Accordingly, the time-limit must be calculated from 4 December 2009, pursuant to section 969 of the Administration Act, even if the applicant only later learned how much the legal costs, including the fees for the defence counsel, amounted to. Thus, the time-limit had expired when the interlocutory appeal was lodged on 17 January 2010.”

Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was refused by the Appeals Permission Board on 18 June 2010.","{'applicant': 'Henrik Mønsted Jensen', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'DNK', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2016}",001-169481

430,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 6563/03) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Irish national, Mr William Shannon (“the applicant”), on 5 February 2003.

The applicant was represented by Mr B. McGrory, a solicitor practising in Belfast. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Grainger, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant alleged that his conviction and fine for failing to reply to questions about specific offences from financial investigators, where he had already been charged with the self-same offences, violated Article 6 of the Convention.

The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

By a decision of 23 November 2004, the Court declared the application admissible.

The parties did not file observations on the merits. The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Belfast.

The applicant was the chair of the Irish Republican Felons Club, a registered social club operating on the Falls Road, Belfast. In May 1997, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (“RUC”) carried out a search of the premises and removed many documents.

The applicant was subsequently required to attend for interview with a financial investigator appointed under the Proceeds of Crime (Northern Ireland) Order 1996. He did so on 27 January 1998 and answered all questions put to him.

On 16 April 1998, the applicant was charged by the police with false accounting and conspiracy to defraud.

On 2 June 1998, a further notice was served on the applicant under the 1996 Order, requiring his attendance before financial investigators at a police station on 11 June 1998. The maximum penalty for failure to attend an interview was six months' imprisonment or a fine not exceeding GBP 5,000. The notice, which was dated 1 June, stated that the investigation was into whether any person had benefited from theft or false accounting, contributing to the resources of a proscribed organisation or from contraventions of betting regulations. The applicant was required to attend at Woodbourne Police Station on 26 June 1998.

On 9 June 1998, the applicant's solicitors sent a letter seeking a written guarantee that no information or statements obtained during the interview would be used in criminal proceedings.

On 16 June 1998, a further notice, dated 16 June, was served on the applicant, again requiring him to attend the interview on 26 June 1998. The notice was served with a letter in which the investigators confirmed that they were aware of the criminal proceedings pending against the applicant. They set out the safeguards in paragraph 6 of Schedule 2 to the Order, and stated that the applicant therefore had the guarantees he sought. They added that paragraph 7 of Schedule 2 restricted the disclosure of information obtained by a financial investigator, and added that “this does not prevent the answers or information being used to further the investigation”.

On 22 June 1998, the applicant's solicitor sent a letter to the financial investigators indicating that the applicant's replies could become admissible evidence at a trial and suggesting that the purpose of the interview was to compel him to disclose his defence. He added that the applicant had been advised not to attend an interview unless a satisfactory response to the letter was received.

On 23 June 1998, the applicant's solicitor was informed by letter that the reason for the interview was not to force the applicant to disclose his defence but that a number of matters from the earlier interview required clarification and additional matters had also arisen.

On a request by the investigators, on 25 June the applicant's representatives informed the investigators that the applicant would not attend the interview. The interview did not take place.

On 14 September 1998, a summons charged the applicant with the offence of failing without reasonable excuse to comply with the financial investigator's requirement to answer questions or otherwise furnish information, contrary to paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 2 to the 1996 Order. On 25 February 1999, the applicant was convicted of this offence in the Magistrates' Court and fined the sum of GBP 200.

On 5 July 2002, the Belfast County Court allowed the applicant's appeal against conviction, finding that the prosecution had not proved the absence of a reasonable excuse. The judge noted that the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal had dealt with a similar case (Clinton v. Bradley [2000] NI 196) which related to the same legislation and the same investigation. The Northern Ireland Court of Appeal had held that as Parliament had put in place certain express limitations on the use of information obtained by investigators, it could not have intended that the person concerned could put forward the risk of self-incrimination as a “reasonable excuse”. In Clinton v. Bradley, however, the accused had refused to answer questions at an interview, and he had not been interviewed by the police, or charged with any offence.

The judge further noted that one of the grounds on which the information obtained by investigators could be used in criminal proceedings was where evidence inconsistent with the information was relied on by the defence. That ground had been amended in the light of the Court's judgment in the case of Saunders v. the United Kingdom, and the amendment would have afforded the applicant the protection he sought had it been in place at the time. The judge took the view that once he had been questioned by the police and charged, the applicant had a right not to answer questions that would have tended to incriminate him. The only outstanding matter was whether the applicant should have attended the interview and then refused to answer questions, or, as he did, refuse to attend the interview once he failed to receive the assurances he had asked for. The judge regarded the distinction as technical, and found that the prosecution had failed to establish the absence of a “reasonable excuse” for not answering questions about the proceeds of a crime, with which he had been formally charged.

On 17 July 2002, the prosecutor requested the County Court to state a case for the purpose of an appeal to the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland.

On 11 December 2002, the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland heard the appeal. On 20 December 2002, Lord Justice Carswell, giving judgment, considered, in the light of R. v. Hertfordshire County Council, ex parte Green Environmental Industries Ltd ([2000] AC 326), that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention is directed towards the fairness of the trial itself and is not concerned with extra-judicial inquiries “with the consequence that a person to whom those inquiries are directed does not have a reasonable excuse for failing or refusing to comply with a financial investigator's requirements merely because the information sought may be potentially incriminating”. The appeal was upheld, and the applicant's conviction confirmed.

The criminal proceedings for false accounting and conspiracy to defraud (see § 10 above) were struck out on grounds of delay by the Belfast Magistrates' Court in June 2002. The magistrate was asked by the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to state a case for the Court of Appeal, but he died before having prepared the stated case.","{'applicant': 'William Shannon', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2005}",001-70364

The applicant was required to attend at Woodbourne Police Station on 26 June 1998.

On 9 June 1998, the applicant's solicitors sent a letter seeking a written guarantee that no information or statements obtained during the interview would be used in criminal proceedings.

On 16 June 1998, a further notice, dated 16 June, was served on the applicant, again requiring him to attend the interview on 26 June 1998. The notice was served with a letter in which the investigators confirmed that they were aware of the criminal proceedings pending against the applicant. They set out the safeguards in paragraph 6 of Schedule 2 to the Order, and stated that the applicant therefore had the guarantees he sought. They added that paragraph 7 of Schedule 2 restricted the disclosure of information obtained by a financial investigator, and added that “this does not prevent the answers or information being used to further the investigation”.

On 22 June 1998, the applicant's solicitor sent a letter to the financial investigators indicating that the applicant's replies could become admissible evidence at a trial and suggesting that the purpose of the interview was to compel him to disclose his defence. He added that the applicant had been advised not to attend an interview unless a satisfactory response to the letter was received.

On 23 June 1998, the applicant's solicitor was informed by letter that the reason for the interview was not to force the applicant to disclose his defence but that a number of matters from the earlier interview required clarification and additional matters had also arisen.

On a request by the investigators, on 25 June the applicant's representatives informed the investigators that the applicant would not attend the interview. The interview did not take place.

On 14 September 1998, a summons charged the applicant with the offence of failing without reasonable excuse to comply with the financial investigator's requirement to answer questions or otherwise furnish information, contrary to paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 2 to the 1996 Order. On 25 February 1999, the applicant was convicted of this offence in the Magistrates' Court and fined the sum of GBP 200.

On 5 July 2002, the Belfast County Court allowed the applicant's appeal against conviction, finding that the prosecution had not proved the absence of a reasonable excuse. The judge noted that the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal had dealt with a similar case (Clinton v. Bradley [2000] NI 196) which related to the same legislation and the same investigation. The Northern Ireland Court of Appeal had held that as Parliament had put in place certain express limitations on the use of information obtained by investigators, it could not have intended that the person concerned could put forward the risk of self-incrimination as a “reasonable excuse”. In Clinton v. Bradley, however, the accused had refused to answer questions at an interview, and he had not been interviewed by the police, or charged with any offence.

The judge further noted that one of the grounds on which the information obtained by investigators could be used in criminal proceedings was where evidence inconsistent with the information was relied on by the defence. That ground had been amended in the light of the Court's judgment in the case of Saunders v. the United Kingdom, and the amendment would have afforded the applicant the protection he sought had it been in place at the time. The judge took the view that once he had been questioned by the police and charged, the applicant had a right not to answer questions that would have tended to incriminate him. The only outstanding matter was whether the applicant should have attended the interview and then refused to answer questions, or, as he did, refuse to attend the interview once he failed to receive the assurances he had asked for. The judge regarded the distinction as technical, and found that the prosecution had failed to establish the absence of a “reasonable excuse” for not answering questions about the proceeds of a crime, with which he had been formally charged.

On 17 July 2002, the prosecutor requested the County Court to state a case for the purpose of an appeal to the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland.

On 11 December 2002, the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland heard the appeal. On 20 December 2002, Lord Justice Carswell, giving judgment, considered, in the light of R. v. Hertfordshire County Council, ex parte Green Environmental Industries Ltd ([2000] AC 326), that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention is directed towards the fairness of the trial itself and is not concerned with extra-judicial inquiries “with the consequence that a person to whom those inquiries are directed does not have a reasonable excuse for failing or refusing to comply with a financial investigator's requirements merely because the information sought may be potentially incriminating”. The appeal was upheld, and the applicant's conviction confirmed.

The criminal proceedings for false accounting and conspiracy to defraud (see § 10 above) were struck out on grounds of delay by the Belfast Magistrates' Court in June 2002. The magistrate was asked by the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to state a case for the Court of Appeal, but he died before having prepared the stated case.","{'applicant': 'William Shannon', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2005}",001-70364

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant is currently serving a sentence of life imprisonment in HM Prison Long Lartin.

On 15 June 1995, Patrick 'Nobby' Clarke was murdered in the flat he had shared with the applicant for the preceding eighteen months. He had been clubbed over the head with what was probably a hammerhead in a sock and possibly another weapon. The applicant was arrested and charged with murder on 16 June 1995.

On 10 July 1996, the applicant was tried for the murder of Mr Clarke, the issue for the jury being whether it was the applicant who was responsible for the murder. He was convicted on 26 July 1996 and on 26 September 1996 appealed against the conviction. On 26 February 1998, the conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal on the basis that the judge had misdirected the jury. A retrial was ordered which took place between 20 July and 5 August 1998, when the jury was unable to reach a verdict and was discharged.

The Crown elected to proceed with a second retrial which began on 22 July 1999. At the outset counsel had unsuccessfully submitted that it was oppressive and an abuse of process to try the applicant again, after two unsuccessful trials. During the trial the applicant dispensed with the services of his counsel and solicitor and proceeded to defend himself, with assistance from a new solicitor. There came a point where he no longer felt able to do so and requested an adjournment. On 2 August 1999, the jury was duly discharged, and a further retrial began on 13 September 1999. The applicant did not give evidence at that trial. On 21 September 1999, he was convicted, by a majority of 10 to 2, and was sentenced to life imprisonment.

At each of the trials the Crown's case was essentially the same, except that a witness called Crittenden, to whom the applicant allegedly made a confession whilst they shared a prison cell, was not relied upon after the first trial, the Crown being of the view that they were not able to present him as a witness of truth. In addition, from the 84 prosecution witnesses called to give evidence at the first trial, only 33 were later called.

On 29 October 1999, the applicant appealed against the conviction. He argued inter alia that the second retrial (in July 1999) was an abuse of process, in that it flouted the convention in English law that if the prosecution has failed to secure a conviction on two occasions it does not then seek a further trial. Although the circumstances were different from those usually relied upon (namely the failure of the jury to reach a verdict on two occasions), it was argued on the applicant's behalf that the first conviction was found not to be safe and so could not be relied upon and on the second occasion the jury could not agree. The discharge of the jury in July 1998 should have been the end of the matter.

On 19 January 2001, the Court of Appeal found that there was no reason to conclude that the practice was applicable in the particular circumstances of the applicant's case. The court noted that there was a practice but not a rule of law for the prosecution not to offer evidence where two juries have disagreed and found no general principle existed barring further retrial where the prosecution had failed twice to secure a conviction. It said: “25. ...Where a serious crime has been committed and it is shown that there is a case to answer as far as a defendant is concerned, there is a clear public interest in having a jury decide positively one way or another, whether that case is established.

Having said that, we recognise the possibility that in any given case a time may come when it would be an abuse of process for the prosecution to try again. Whether that situation arises must depend on the facts of the case which include, first, the overall period of delay and the reasons for the delay; second, the results of previous trials; thirdly, the seriousness of the offence or offences under consideration; and fourthly, possibly, the extent to which the case now to be met has changed from that which was considered in previous trials.

Here the prosecution case did change in that reliance ceased to be placed on the evidence of a man called Crittenden, a prisoner who had given evidence in the first trial as to what had allegedly been said by the [applicant]. But the changes in the prosecution case cannot, in our judgment, have rendered it impossible for the [applicant] to have a fair trial. The reality was he no longer had to face evidence which was adduced in the previous trial as to what he himself had said when attempting to deal with the evidence of Crittenden. ...

... For the reasons we have given we are satisfied that the abuse of process argument was rightly rejected here.”

The Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords, but certified two questions of law of general public importance, namely, “1. Whether a defendant having been tried twice without a safe verdict being returned it is oppressive to try him a third time and hence an abuse of the court's process.

Whether it is oppressive for the Crown to depart from its established practice of not trying a defendant for a third time, absent compelling fresh evidence or conduct by the defendant causing the retrials.”

On 17 June 2001, the House of Lords refused the petition for leave.","{'applicant': 'Frank Henworth', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2004}",001-67243

He had been clubbed over the head with what was probably a hammerhead in a sock and possibly another weapon. The applicant was arrested and charged with murder on 16 June 1995.

On 10 July 1996, the applicant was tried for the murder of Mr Clarke, the issue for the jury being whether it was the applicant who was responsible for the murder. He was convicted on 26 July 1996 and on 26 September 1996 appealed against the conviction. On 26 February 1998, the conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal on the basis that the judge had misdirected the jury. A retrial was ordered which took place between 20 July and 5 August 1998, when the jury was unable to reach a verdict and was discharged.

The Crown elected to proceed with a second retrial which began on 22 July 1999. At the outset counsel had unsuccessfully submitted that it was oppressive and an abuse of process to try the applicant again, after two unsuccessful trials. During the trial the applicant dispensed with the services of his counsel and solicitor and proceeded to defend himself, with assistance from a new solicitor. There came a point where he no longer felt able to do so and requested an adjournment. On 2 August 1999, the jury was duly discharged, and a further retrial began on 13 September 1999. The applicant did not give evidence at that trial. On 21 September 1999, he was convicted, by a majority of 10 to 2, and was sentenced to life imprisonment.

At each of the trials the Crown's case was essentially the same, except that a witness called Crittenden, to whom the applicant allegedly made a confession whilst they shared a prison cell, was not relied upon after the first trial, the Crown being of the view that they were not able to present him as a witness of truth. In addition, from the 84 prosecution witnesses called to give evidence at the first trial, only 33 were later called.

On 29 October 1999, the applicant appealed against the conviction. He argued inter alia that the second retrial (in July 1999) was an abuse of process, in that it flouted the convention in English law that if the prosecution has failed to secure a conviction on two occasions it does not then seek a further trial. Although the circumstances were different from those usually relied upon (namely the failure of the jury to reach a verdict on two occasions), it was argued on the applicant's behalf that the first conviction was found not to be safe and so could not be relied upon and on the second occasion the jury could not agree. The discharge of the jury in July 1998 should have been the end of the matter.

On 19 January 2001, the Court of Appeal found that there was no reason to conclude that the practice was applicable in the particular circumstances of the applicant's case. The court noted that there was a practice but not a rule of law for the prosecution not to offer evidence where two juries have disagreed and found no general principle existed barring further retrial where the prosecution had failed twice to secure a conviction. It said: “25. ...Where a serious crime has been committed and it is shown that there is a case to answer as far as a defendant is concerned, there is a clear public interest in having a jury decide positively one way or another, whether that case is established.

Having said that, we recognise the possibility that in any given case a time may come when it would be an abuse of process for the prosecution to try again. Whether that situation arises must depend on the facts of the case which include, first, the overall period of delay and the reasons for the delay; second, the results of previous trials; thirdly, the seriousness of the offence or offences under consideration; and fourthly, possibly, the extent to which the case now to be met has changed from that which was considered in previous trials.

Here the prosecution case did change in that reliance ceased to be placed on the evidence of a man called Crittenden, a prisoner who had given evidence in the first trial as to what had allegedly been said by the [applicant]. But the changes in the prosecution case cannot, in our judgment, have rendered it impossible for the [applicant] to have a fair trial. The reality was he no longer had to face evidence which was adduced in the previous trial as to what he himself had said when attempting to deal with the evidence of Crittenden. ...

... For the reasons we have given we are satisfied that the abuse of process argument was rightly rejected here.”

The Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords, but certified two questions of law of general public importance, namely, “1. Whether a defendant having been tried twice without a safe verdict being returned it is oppressive to try him a third time and hence an abuse of the court's process.

Whether it is oppressive for the Crown to depart from its established practice of not trying a defendant for a third time, absent compelling fresh evidence or conduct by the defendant causing the retrials.”

On 17 June 2001, the House of Lords refused the petition for leave.","{'applicant': 'Frank Henworth', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2004}",001-67243
438,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 515/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Frank Henworth (“the applicant”), on 15 December 2001.

The applicant was not represented. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Willmott of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant alleged that the criminal proceedings, concerning his trial for murder, exceeded a reasonable length of time.

The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

By a decision of 14 January 2003, the Court declared part of the application inadmissible and invited the respondent Government to submit observations on the remaining complaints. On 6 September 2003, the Court declared the remainder of the application partly admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

439,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 42007/98) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Vernon John Davies (“the applicant”), on 29 October 1997.

The applicant was represented before the Court by Ms J. Rickards and Mr J.P. Gardner, solicitors practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Helen Upton, Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant alleged, in particular, a breach of his right under Article 6 § 1 to a fair hearing within a reasonable time.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

The application was originally allocated to the Third Section of the Court, which declared it partly inadmissible on 26 September 2000. On 23 October 2001 the Third Section declared the application admissible insofar as the applicant complained about the length of the “Blackspur” proceedings, and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.

On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1 of the Rules of Court) and the application was allocated to the newly composed Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.

The applicant, but not the Government, filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine). On 15 April 2002 the Government submitted observations in connection with the applicant's claims under Article 41 of the Convention.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The Blackspur group of companies (collectively, “Blackspur”), was formed by the applicant and others in September 1987 and at various times the applicant acted as director and chairman. Blackspur went into receivership in July 1990 with an estimated deficit of GBP 34 million.

On 1 July 1992, on the last day of the applicable two year limitation period, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (“the Secretary of State”) issued proceedings against the applicant and four others (“the Blackspur proceedings”) under section 6 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 (“the CDDA”: see paragraphs 19-20 below).

The Secretary of State's evidence was not complete at the time he commenced proceedings, and he applied for an extension of time for the serving of evidence (see paragraph 21 below). The applicant refused to consent to an extension being granted and instead, on 13 October 1992, together with two other defendants, applied to strike out the proceedings.

The Secretary of State's evidence was completed and served on the applicant on 14 December 1992. The application for permission to file the evidence out of time, and the cross-application to strike out the proceedings, were not heard by the Registrar until 20 May 1993, when they were adjourned to 29 July 1993. On 27 January 1994 the Registrar granted the Secretary of State's application for an extension of time and dismissed the applicant's strike-out application. The applicant appealed to the High Court.

Related criminal charges had been brought against the four other defendants in the Blackspur proceedings, but not the applicant, on 1 July 1992. The criminal trial took place between March and June 1994, during which period the disqualification proceedings were adjourned generally, with liberty to restore. At the conclusion of the criminal trial, two defendants were acquitted and two were convicted. On appeal, the two convictions were quashed in February 1995.

By letters dated 19 July and 16 September 1994 the defendants to the Blackspur disqualification proceedings wrote to the Secretary of State inviting him to reconsider whether to carry on with the proceedings. On 15 December 1994 the Treasury Solicitor replied that the Secretary of State had decided that it remained expedient in the public interest to continue.

Once the criminal trial had been concluded, the applicant's appeal to the High Court against the Registrar's decision of 27 January 1994 could proceed and was dismissed on 2 May 1995. In November 1995 the applicant was granted leave to appeal out of time to the Court of Appeal, and his substantive appeal was dismissed by that court on 24 May 1996. The Court of Appeal found that the reasons for the Secretary of State's failure to complete his evidence before the proceedings were commenced had been “far from satisfactory”, but considered nonetheless that the case should proceed since it was in the public interest to determine the “particularly serious” allegations of false accounting and trading while insolvent made against the defendants. In addition, the court observed that the delay by the Secretary of State had not affected the timing of the hearing or prejudiced the applicant, and that, once the proceedings had commenced, “the respondents' main concern was to delay the proceedings until after the conclusion of the criminal trial, not to hurry them on”.

On 1 July 1996 the Registrar directed that the defendants should serve their evidence in response to that of the Secretary of State by 29 November 1996. That order was not complied with, and on 9 December 1996 the Registrar ordered that if the defendants had not served their evidence by 17 January 1997, they would be debarred from adducing any evidence.

The defendants served their evidence on 17 January 1997. On 20 January 1997 the Registrar directed that the Secretary of State should serve his evidence in reply by 17 March 1997. On 14 April 1997 the Registrar granted the Secretary of State a time-extension for the serving of evidence in reply until 30 June 1997, and this evidence was in fact served on 10 July 1997. At a further directions hearing on 4 August 1997 the defendants were given permission to adduce additional evidence in rejoinder by 1 December 1997. The applicant failed to comply with this order and on 8 December 1997 he was granted an extension of time until 9 February 1998.

In the event, however, the Blackspur proceedings against the applicant were discontinued on 12 January 1998, after a “Carecraft” agreement (see paragraph 23 below) was reached between the applicant and the Secretary of State in other proceedings under the CDDA. As part of the settlement, the applicant agreed to pay the Secretary of State's costs of GBP 94,000.","{'applicant': 'Vernon John Davies', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2002}",001-60613

The case originated in an application (no. 42007/98) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Vernon John Davies (“the applicant”), on 29 October 1997.

The applicant was represented before the Court by Ms J. Rickards and Mr J.P. Gardner, solicitors practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Helen Upton, Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant alleged, in particular, a breach of his right under Article 6 § 1 to a fair hearing within a reasonable time.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

The application was originally allocated to the Third Section of the Court, which declared it partly inadmissible on 26 September 2000. On 23 October 2001 the Third Section declared the application admissible insofar as the applicant complained about the length of the “Blackspur” proceedings, and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.

On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1 of the Rules of Court) and the application was allocated to the newly composed Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.

The applicant, but not the Government, filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine). On 15 April 2002 the Government submitted observations in connection with the applicant's claims under Article 41 of the Convention.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The Blackspur group of companies (collectively, “Blackspur”), was formed by the applicant and others in September 1987 and at various times the applicant acted as director and chairman. Blackspur went into receivership in July 1990 with an estimated deficit of GBP 34 million.

On 1 July 1992, on the last day of the applicable two year limitation period, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (“the Secretary of State”) issued proceedings against the applicant and four others (“the Blackspur proceedings”) under section 6 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 (“the CDDA”: see paragraphs 19-20 below).

The Secretary of State's evidence was not complete at the time he commenced proceedings, and he applied for an extension of time for the serving of evidence (see paragraph 21 below). The applicant refused to consent to an extension being granted and instead, on 13 October 1992, together with two other defendants, applied to strike out the proceedings.

The Secretary of State's evidence was completed and served on the applicant on 14 December 1992. The application for permission to file the evidence out of time, and the cross-application to strike out the proceedings, were not heard by the Registrar until 20 May 1993, when they were adjourned to 29 July 1993. On 27 January 1994 the Registrar granted the Secretary of State's application for an extension of time and dismissed the applicant's strike-out application. The applicant appealed to the High Court.

Related criminal charges had been brought against the four other defendants in the Blackspur proceedings, but not the applicant, on 1 July 1992. The criminal trial took place between March and June 1994, during which period the disqualification proceedings were adjourned generally, with liberty to restore. At the conclusion of the criminal trial, two defendants were acquitted and two were convicted. On appeal, the two convictions were quashed in February 1995.

By letters dated 19 July and 16 September 1994 the defendants to the Blackspur disqualification proceedings wrote to the Secretary of State inviting him to reconsider whether to carry on with the proceedings. On 15 December 1994 the Treasury Solicitor replied that the Secretary of State had decided that it remained expedient in the public interest to continue.

Once the criminal trial had been concluded, the applicant's appeal to the High Court against the Registrar's decision of 27 January 1994 could proceed and was dismissed on 2 May 1995. In November 1995 the applicant was granted leave to appeal out of time to the Court of Appeal, and his substantive appeal was dismissed by that court on 24 May 1996. The Court of Appeal found that the reasons for the Secretary of State's failure to complete his evidence before the proceedings were commenced had been “far from satisfactory”, but considered nonetheless that the case should proceed since it was in the public interest to determine the “particularly serious” allegations of false accounting and trading while insolvent made against the defendants. In addition, the court observed that the delay by the Secretary of State had not affected the timing of the hearing or prejudiced the applicant, and that, once the proceedings had commenced, “the respondents' main concern was to delay the proceedings until after the conclusion of the criminal trial, not to hurry them on”.

On 1 July 1996 the Registrar directed that the defendants should serve their evidence in response to that of the Secretary of State by 29 November 1996. That order was not complied with, and on 9 December 1996 the Registrar ordered that if the defendants had not served their evidence by 17 January 1997, they would be debarred from adducing any evidence.

The defendants served their evidence on 17 January 1997. On 20 January 1997 the Registrar directed that the Secretary of State should serve his evidence in reply by 17 March 1997. On 14 April 1997 the Registrar granted the Secretary of State a time-extension for the serving of evidence in reply until 30 June 1997, and this evidence was in fact served on 10 July 1997. At a further directions hearing on 4 August 1997 the defendants were given permission to adduce additional evidence in rejoinder by 1 December 1997. The applicant failed to comply with this order and on 8 December 1997 he was granted an extension of time until 9 February 1998.

In the event, however, the Blackspur proceedings against the applicant were discontinued on 12 January 1998, after a “Carecraft” agreement (see paragraph 23 below) was reached between the applicant and the Secretary of State in other proceedings under the CDDA. As part of the settlement, the applicant agreed to pay the Secretary of State's costs of GBP 94,000.","{'applicant': 'Vernon John Davies', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2002}",001-60613

444,"PROCEDURE

The case concerned five applications (nos. 47676/99, 58923/00, 58927/00, 61373/00 and 61377/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Ms Julie Beet and four others (“the applicants”), who are United Kingdom nationals, on various dates from 1 April 1999 to 13 February 2001.

The applicants, several of whom had been granted legal aid, were represented by Dicksons HMB, solicitors practising in Stoke-on-Trent. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Emily Willmott of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicants alleged that their detention ordered by the magistrates for failure to pay local taxes or court-imposed fines were unlawful contrary to Article 5 § 1 of the Convention and that they had not been entitled to compensation under domestic law contrary to Article 5 § 5 of the Convention. They further complained under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) that they were not offered legal representation and were not represented at the hearing at which they were sentenced to a term of imprisonment.

The applications were allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

On 1 November 2001, these cases were assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).

By a decision of 21 October 2003, the Court declared admissible the claims under Article 5 of the applicant Beet (47676/99) and the claims under Article 6 of all the applicants, except Beet (47676/99). The remainder of the applicants’ complaints were declared inadmissible.

The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required. On 1 November 2004 these cases were assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES

The details concerning the date of birth and place of residence of the five applicants are contained in their application forms and are available in the respective case files.

Each applicant failed to pay sums due in respect of either local taxes (community charge or council tax), or court-imposed fines. In respect of the failure to pay local taxes, the magistrates’ court had in each case determined that the applicant was liable to pay (issuing a “liability order”); in fines cases, the magistrates’ court had imposed the fine as the sentence following a criminal conviction.

Each applicant fell into arrears with the payments due from them. These cases involve the enforcement proceedings in respect of their arrears in the magistrates’ court. Each applicant appeared before the court, following the issuing of an application for their committal to prison as a result of their failure to pay the sums due. At that hearing the magistrates found that the non-payment was due to the applicant’s wilful refusal or culpable neglect. As a result each applicant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment, suspended on terms that the applicant make periodic payments towards the outstanding sum. The applicants failed to comply with the terms imposed. A further hearing was thereafter held in the magistrates’ court at which the suspended term of imprisonment was activated. Each applicant spent a period of time in prison. Legal aid (free legal representation where the applicant did not have sufficient means to pay for it) was not available for these enforcement proceedings prior to 1 June 1997 and none of the applicants was legally represented at the hearings in front of the magistrates.

Following their imprisonment, an application was made on behalf of each applicant, by way of either judicial review or case stated, which resulted in the High Court quashing the orders made by the magistrates. The applicants were released from prison on bail at the time of making their applications to the High Court. In all five cases the orders were quashed following the High Court’s approval of a consent order agreed between the applicants and the magistrates who had sentenced them.

The Court has set out the relevant facts pertaining to each applicant in the table which appears at the end of the decision on admissibility (47675/99, McAndrew and Others v. the United Kingdom, decision of 21 October 2003). That table sets out the following information in respect of each applicant: their name and application number; whether their case involved non-payment of community charge (“CC”), council tax (“CT”) or fines (“F”) and the number of days which they spent in prison; whether their proceedings in the magistrates’ court took place before or after legal aid became available on 1 June 1997; and the grounds upon which the High Court quashed the orders of the magistrates. A summary of the terms of the consent order whereby the orders of the magistrates were quashed is also set out in the table.

Throughout the text of this decision, where there is a reference to a specific applicant, the Court has set out the surname of the applicant followed by their application number in brackets. The words “justices” and “magistrates” are synonymous in domestic law.

The Court sets out the facts of one case more fully below. Julie BEET (47676/99)

The applicant’s proceedings before the magistrates arose in respect of her arrears in payment of the community charge and took place after 1 June 1997. She spent a total of 2 days in prison. The orders of the magistrates’ court were quashed by the High Court as a result of a consent order in which it was agreed that: “(i) The decision of the justices that the applicant had culpably neglected to pay her community charge without having conducted a proper inquiry into her circumstances as of the time that the liability became due was unlawful, see R. v. Leeds Justices ex parte Kennett [1996] RVR 53. (ii) The decision of the justices to issue a sentence of committal to prison and to make an order postponing the issue of the warrant that would have left the threat of imprisonment over her for over 4 years was unlawful having regard to the principles laid down in R. v. Oliver and Oliver [1989] 11 Cr App R(S) 10 and R. v. Ealing Justices ex parte Cloves [1991] RVR 169 and R. v. Newcastle upon Tyne Justices ex parte Devine [1998] RA 97. (iii) In view of the circumstances of the applicant and [her] detention, and the period of detention served, all parties agreed that the matter be remitted back to the magistrates and that the magistrates, upon reviewing the matter, agreed to remit the outstanding community charge arrears, see Brooke LJ in R. v. St Helens Justices ex parte Jones CO/3328/95.” In respect of costs, it was further agreed that: “... in view of the fact that the Hull Justices had acknowledged the same ground in quashing the committal in R. v.

In all five cases the orders were quashed following the High Court’s approval of a consent order agreed between the applicants and the magistrates who had sentenced them.

The Court has set out the relevant facts pertaining to each applicant in the table which appears at the end of the decision on admissibility (47675/99, McAndrew and Others v. the United Kingdom, decision of 21 October 2003). That table sets out the following information in respect of each applicant: their name and application number; whether their case involved non-payment of community charge (“CC”), council tax (“CT”) or fines (“F”) and the number of days which they spent in prison; whether their proceedings in the magistrates’ court took place before or after legal aid became available on 1 June 1997; and the grounds upon which the High Court quashed the orders of the magistrates. A summary of the terms of the consent order whereby the orders of the magistrates were quashed is also set out in the table.

Throughout the text of this decision, where there is a reference to a specific applicant, the Court has set out the surname of the applicant followed by their application number in brackets. The words “justices” and “magistrates” are synonymous in domestic law.

The applicant’s proceedings before the magistrates arose in respect of her arrears in payment of the community charge and took place after 1 June 1997. She spent a total of 2 days in prison. The orders of the magistrates’ court were quashed by the High Court as a result of a consent order in which it was agreed that: “(i) The decision of the justices that the applicant had culpably neglected to pay her community charge without having conducted a proper inquiry into her circumstances as of the time that the liability became due was unlawful, see R. v. Leeds Justices ex parte Kennett [1996] RVR 53. (ii) The decision of the justices to issue a sentence of committal to prison and to make an order postponing the issue of the warrant that would have left the threat of imprisonment over her for over 4 years was unlawful having regard to the principles laid down in R. v. Oliver and Oliver [1989] 11 Cr App R(S) 10 and R. v. Ealing Justices ex parte Cloves [1991] RVR 169 and R. v. Newcastle upon Tyne Justices ex parte Devine [1998] RA 97. (iii) In view of the circumstances of the applicant and [her] detention, and the period of detention served, all parties agreed that the matter be remitted back to the magistrates and that the magistrates, upon reviewing the matter, agreed to remit the outstanding community charge arrears, see Brooke LJ in R. v. St Helens Justices ex parte Jones CO/3328/95.” In respect of costs, it was further agreed that: “... in view of the fact that the Hull Justices had acknowledged the same ground in quashing the committal in R. v.

The case concerned five applications (nos. 47676/99, 58923/00, 58927/00, 61373/00 and 61377/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Ms Julie Beet and four others (“the applicants”), who are United Kingdom nationals, on various dates from 1 April 1999 to 13 February 2001.

The applicants, several of whom had been granted legal aid, were represented by Dicksons HMB, solicitors practising in Stoke-on-Trent. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Emily Willmott of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicants alleged that their detention ordered by the magistrates for failure to pay local taxes or court-imposed fines were unlawful contrary to Article 5 § 1 of the Convention and that they had not been entitled to compensation under domestic law contrary to Article 5 § 5 of the Convention. They further complained under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) that they were not offered legal representation and were not represented at the hearing at which they were sentenced to a term of imprisonment.

The applications were allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

On 1 November 2001, these cases were assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).

By a decision of 21 October 2003, the Court declared admissible the claims under Article 5 of the applicant Beet (47676/99) and the claims under Article 6 of all the applicants, except Beet (47676/99). The remainder of the applicants’ complaints were declared inadmissible.

The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required. On 1 November 2004 these cases were assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES

The details concerning the date of birth and place of residence of the five applicants are contained in their application forms and are available in the respective case files.

Each applicant failed to pay sums due in respect of either local taxes (community charge or council tax), or court-imposed fines. In respect of the failure to pay local taxes, the magistrates’ court had in each case determined that the applicant was liable to pay (issuing a “liability order”); in fines cases, the magistrates’ court had imposed the fine as the sentence following a criminal conviction.

Each applicant fell into arrears with the payments due from them. These cases involve the enforcement proceedings in respect of their arrears in the magistrates’ court. Each applicant appeared before the court, following the issuing of an application for their committal to prison as a result of their failure to pay the sums due. At that hearing the magistrates found that the non-payment was due to the applicant’s wilful refusal or culpable neglect. As a result each applicant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment, suspended on terms that the applicant make periodic payments towards the outstanding sum. The applicants failed to comply with the terms imposed. A further hearing was thereafter held in the magistrates’ court at which the suspended term of imprisonment was activated. Each applicant spent a period of time in prison. Legal aid (free legal representation where the applicant did not have sufficient means to pay for it) was not available for these enforcement proceedings prior to 1 June 1997 and none of the applicants was legally represented at the hearings in front of the magistrates.

Following their imprisonment, an application was made on behalf of each applicant, by way of either judicial review or case stated, which resulted in the High Court quashing the orders made by the magistrates. The applicants were released from prison on bail at the time of making their applications to the High Court. In all five cases the orders were quashed following the High Court’s approval of a consent order agreed between the applicants and the magistrates who had sentenced them.

The Court has set out the relevant facts pertaining to each applicant in the table which appears at the end of the decision on admissibility (47675/99, McAndrew and Others v. the United Kingdom, decision of 21 October 2003). That table sets out the following information in respect of each applicant: their name and application number; whether their case involved non-payment of community charge (“CC”), council tax (“CT”) or fines (“F”) and the number of days which they spent in prison; whether their proceedings in the magistrates’ court took place before or after legal aid became available on 1 June 1997; and the grounds upon which the High Court quashed the orders of the magistrates.

The case originated in an application (no. 28957/95) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Ms Christine Goodwin (“the applicant”), on 5 June 1995.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Bindman and Partners, solicitors practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant alleged violations of Articles 8, 12, 13 and 14 of the Convention in respect of the legal status of transsexuals in the United Kingdom and particularly their treatment in the sphere of employment, social security, pensions and marriage.

The application was declared admissible by the Commission on 1 December 1997 and transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1999 in accordance with Article 5 § 3, second sentence, of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention, the Commission not having completed its examination of the case by that date.

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court).

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

On 11 September 2001, a Chamber of that Section, composed of the following judges: Mr J.-P. Costa, Mr W. Fuhrmann, Mr P. Kūris, Mrs F. Tulkens, Mr K. Jungwiert, Sir Nicolas Bratza and Mr K. Traja, and also of Mrs S. Dollé, Section Registrar, relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber, neither of the parties having objected to relinquishment (Article 30 of the Convention and Rule 72).

The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 27 §§ 2 and 3 of the Convention and Rule 24 of the Rules of Court. The President of the Court decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the case should be assigned to the Grand Chamber that had been constituted to hear the case of I. v. the United Kingdom (application no. 25680/94) (Rules 24, 43 § 2 and 71).

The applicant and the Government each filed a memorial on the merits. In addition, third-party comments were received from Liberty, which had been given leave by the President to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 61 § 3).

A hearing in this case and the case of I. v. the United Kingdom (no. 25680/94) took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 20 March 2002 (Rule 59 § 2). There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr D. Walton, Agent, Mr Rabinder Singh, Counsel, Mr J. Strachan, Counsel, Mr C. Lloyd, Ms A. Powick, Ms S. Eisa, Advisers; (b) for the applicant Ms L. Cox, Q.C., Counsel, Mr T. Eicke, Counsel, Ms J. Sohrab, Solicitor. The applicant was also present. The Court heard addresses by Ms Cox and Mr Rabinder Singh.

On 3 July 2002, Mrs Tsatsa-Nikolovska and Mr Zagrebelsky who were unable to take part in further consideration of the case, were replaced by Mrs Mularoni and Mr Caflisch.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant is a United Kingdom citizen born in 1937 and is a post-operative male to female transsexual.

The applicant had a tendency to dress as a woman from early childhood and underwent aversion therapy in 1963-64. In the mid-1960s, she was diagnosed as a transsexual. Though she married a woman and they had four children, her conviction was that her “brain sex” did not fit her body. From that time until 1984 she dressed as a man for work but as a woman in her free time. In January 1985, the applicant began treatment in earnest, attending appointments once every three months at the Gender Identity Clinic at the Charing Cross Hospital, which included regular consultations with a psychiatrist as well as on occasion a psychologist. She was prescribed hormone therapy, began attending grooming classes and voice training. Since this time, she has lived fully as a woman. In October 1986, she underwent surgery to shorten her vocal chords. In August 1987, she was accepted on the waiting list for gender re-assignment surgery. In 1990, she underwent gender re-assignment surgery at a National Health Service hospital. Her treatment and surgery was provided for and paid for by the National Health Service.

The applicant divorced from her former wife on a date unspecified but continued to enjoy the love and support of her children.

The applicant claims that between 1990 and 1992 she was sexually harassed by colleagues at work. She attempted to pursue a case of sexual harassment in the Industrial Tribunal but claimed that she was unsuccessful because she was considered in law to be a man. She did not challenge this decision by appealing to the Employment Appeal Tribunal. The applicant was subsequently dismissed from her employment for reasons connected with her health, but alleges that the real reason was that she was a transsexual.

In 1996, the applicant started work with a new employer and was required to provide her National Insurance (“NI”) number. She was concerned that the new employer would be in a position to trace her details as once in the possession of the number it would have been possible to find out about her previous employers and obtain information from them. Although she requested the allocation of a new NI number from the Department of Social Security (“DSS”), this was rejected and she eventually gave the new employer her NI number. The applicant claims that the new employer has now traced back her identity as she began experiencing problems at work. Colleagues stopped speaking to her and she was told that everyone was talking about her behind her back.

The DSS Contributions Agency informed the applicant that she would be ineligible for a State pension at the age of 60, the age of entitlement for women in the United Kingdom. In April 1997, the DSS informed the applicant that her pension contributions would have to be continued until the date at which she reached the age of 65, being the age of entitlement for men, namely April 2002. On 23 April 1997, she therefore entered into an undertaking with the DSS to pay direct the NI contributions which would otherwise be deducted by her employer as for all male employees. In the light of this undertaking, on 2 May 1997, the DSS Contributions Agency issued the applicant with a Form CF 384 Age Exemption Certificate (see Relevant domestic law and practice below).

The applicant's files at the DSS were marked “sensitive” to ensure that only an employee of a particular grade had access to her files. This meant in practice that the applicant had to make special appointments for even the most trivial matters and could not deal directly with the local office or deal with queries over the telephone. Her record continues to state her sex as male and despite the “special procedures” she has received letters from the DSS addressed to the male name which she was given at birth.

In a number of instances, the applicant stated that she has had to choose between revealing her birth certificate and foregoing certain advantages which were conditional upon her producing her birth certificate. In particular, she has not followed through a loan conditional upon life insurance, a re-mortgage offer and an entitlement to winter fuel allowance from the DSS. Similarly, the applicant remains obliged to pay the higher motor insurance premiums applicable to men. Nor did she feel able to report a theft of 200 pounds sterling to the police, for fear that the investigation would require her to reveal her identity.","{'applicant': 'Christine Goodwin', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 50, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 44, 32, 34, 51, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'GRANDCHAMBER', 'year': 2002}",001-60596

The applicant's files at the DSS were marked “sensitive” to ensure that only an employee of a particular grade had access to her files. This meant in practice that the applicant had to make special appointments for even the most trivial matters and could not deal directly with the local office or deal with queries over the telephone. Her record continues to state her sex as male and despite the “special procedures” she has received letters from the DSS addressed to the male name which she was given at birth.

In a number of instances, the applicant stated that she has had to choose between revealing her birth certificate and foregoing certain advantages which were conditional upon her producing her birth certificate. In particular, she has not followed through a loan conditional upon life insurance, a re-mortgage offer and an entitlement to winter fuel allowance from the DSS. Similarly, the applicant remains obliged to pay the higher motor insurance premiums applicable to men. Nor did she feel able to report a theft of 200 pounds sterling to the police, for fear that the investigation would require her to reveal her identity.","{'applicant': 'Christine Goodwin', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 50, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 44, 32, 34, 51, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'GRANDCHAMBER', 'year': 2002}",001-60596

The case originated in an application (no. 28957/95) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Ms Christine Goodwin (“the applicant”), on 5 June 1995.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Bindman and Partners, solicitors practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant alleged violations of Articles 8, 12, 13 and 14 of the Convention in respect of the legal status of transsexuals in the United Kingdom and particularly their treatment in the sphere of employment, social security, pensions and marriage.

The application was declared admissible by the Commission on 1 December 1997 and transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1999 in accordance with Article 5 § 3, second sentence, of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention, the Commission not having completed its examination of the case by that date.

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court).

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

On 11 September 2001, a Chamber of that Section, composed of the following judges: Mr J.-P. Costa, Mr W. Fuhrmann, Mr P. Kūris, Mrs F. Tulkens, Mr K. Jungwiert, Sir Nicolas Bratza and Mr K. Traja, and also of Mrs S. Dollé, Section Registrar, relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber, neither of the parties having objected to relinquishment (Article 30 of the Convention and Rule 72).

The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 27 §§ 2 and 3 of the Convention and Rule 24 of the Rules of Court. The President of the Court decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the case should be assigned to the Grand Chamber that had been constituted to hear the case of I. v. the United Kingdom (application no. 25680/94) (Rules 24, 43 § 2 and 71).

The applicant and the Government each filed a memorial on the merits. In addition, third-party comments were received from Liberty, which had been given leave by the President to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 61 § 3).

A hearing in this case and the case of I. v. the United Kingdom (no. 25680/94) took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 20 March 2002 (Rule 59 § 2). There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr D. Walton, Agent, Mr Rabinder Singh, Counsel, Mr J. Strachan, Counsel, Mr C. Lloyd, Ms A. Powick, Ms S. Eisa, Advisers; (b) for the applicant Ms L. Cox, Q.C., Counsel, Mr T. Eicke, Counsel, Ms J. Sohrab, Solicitor. The applicant was also present. The Court heard addresses by Ms Cox and Mr Rabinder Singh.

On 3 July 2002, Mrs Tsatsa-Nikolovska and Mr Zagrebelsky who were unable to take part in further consideration of the case, were replaced by Mrs Mularoni and Mr Caflisch.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant is a United Kingdom citizen born in 1937 and is a post-operative male to female transsexual.

The applicant had a tendency to dress as a woman from early childhood and underwent aversion therapy in 1963-64. In the mid-1960s, she was diagnosed as a transsexual. Though she married a woman and they had four children, her conviction was that her “brain sex” did not fit her body. From that time until 1984 she dressed as a man for work but as a woman in her free time. In January 1985, the applicant began treatment in earnest, attending appointments once every three months at the Gender Identity Clinic at the Charing Cross Hospital, which included regular consultations with a psychiatrist as well as on occasion a psychologist. She was prescribed hormone therapy, began attending grooming classes and voice training. Since this time, she has lived fully as a woman. In October 1986, she underwent surgery to shorten her vocal chords. In August 1987, she was accepted on the waiting list for gender re-assignment surgery. In 1990, she underwent gender re-assignment surgery at a National Health Service hospital. Her treatment and surgery was provided for and paid for by the National Health Service.

The applicant divorced from her former wife on a date unspecified but continued to enjoy the love and support of her children.

The applicant claims that between 1990 and 1992 she was sexually harassed by colleagues at work. She attempted to pursue a case of sexual harassment in the Industrial Tribunal but claimed that she was unsuccessful because she was considered in law to be a man. She did not challenge this decision by appealing to the Employment Appeal Tribunal. The applicant was subsequently dismissed from her employment for reasons connected with her health, but alleges that the real reason was that she was a transsexual.

In 1996, the applicant started work with a new employer and was required to provide her National Insurance (“NI”) number. She was concerned that the new employer would be in a position to trace her details as once in the possession of the number it would have been possible to find out about her previous employers and obtain information from them. Although she requested the allocation of a new NI number from the Department of Social Security (“DSS”), this was rejected and she eventually gave the new employer her NI number. The applicant claims that the new employer has now traced back her identity as she began experiencing problems at work. Colleagues stopped speaking to her and she was told that everyone was talking about her behind her back.

The DSS Contributions Agency informed the applicant that she would be ineligible for a State pension at the age of 60, the age of entitlement for women in the United Kingdom. In April 1997, the DSS informed the applicant that her pension contributions would have to be continued until the date at which she reached the age of 65, being the age of entitlement for men, namely April 2002. On 23 April 1997, she therefore entered into an undertaking with the DSS to pay direct the NI contributions which would otherwise be deducted by her employer as for all male employees. In the light of this undertaking, on 2 May 1997, the DSS Contributions Agency issued the applicant with a Form CF 384 Age Exemption Certificate (see Relevant domestic law and practice below).

The applicant's files at the DSS were marked “sensitive” to ensure that only an employee of a particular grade had access to her files. This meant in practice that the applicant had to make special appointments for even the most trivial matters and could not deal directly with the local office or deal with queries over the telephone. Her record continues to state her sex as male and despite the “special procedures” she has received letters from the DSS addressed to the male name which she was given at birth.

In a number of instances, the applicant stated that she has had to choose between revealing her birth certificate and foregoing certain advantages which were conditional upon her producing her birth certificate. In particular, she has not followed through a loan conditional upon life insurance, a re-mortgage offer and an entitlement to winter fuel allowance from the DSS. Similarly, the applicant remains obliged to pay the higher motor insurance premiums applicable to men. Nor did she feel able to report a theft of 200 pounds sterling to the police, for fear that the investigation would require her to reveal her identity.","{'applicant': 'Christine Goodwin', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 50, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 44, 32, 34, 51, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'GRANDCHAMBER', 'year': 2002}",001-60596
452,"PROCEDURE

The present case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 12 October 1983, within the three-month period laid down by Articles 32 para. 1 and 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 8777/79) against the Kingdom of Denmark lodged with the Commission on 21 May 1979 under Article 25 (art. 25) by Mr. Per Krohn Rasmussen, a Danish national.

The Commission's request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Denmark recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether or not the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Articles 6 and 8 (art. 14+6, art. 14+8).

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).

The Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mr. J. Gersing, the elected judge of Danish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. G. Wiarda, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 27 October 1983, the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely Mr. M. Zekia, Mr. W. Ganshof van der Meersch, Mr. F. Matscher, Mr. B. Walsh and Mr. R. Macdonald (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). Subsequently, Mr. Zekia and Mr. Walsh, who were prevented from taking part in the consideration of the case, were replaced by Mr. C. Russo and Mrs. D. Bindschedler-Robert, substitute judges (Rules 22 para. 1 and 24 para. 1).

Mr. Wiarda, who had assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), ascertained, through the Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Danish Government (“the Government“), the Delegate of the Commission and the representative of the applicant regarding the necessity for a written procedure (Rule 37 para. 1). On 14 November 1983, the President directed that the Agent and the representative should each have until 15 February 1984 to file a memorial and that the Delegate should be entitled to reply in writing within two months from the date of the transmission to him by the Registrar of whichever of the aforesaid documents should last be filed. On 6 February 1984, the President extended the first time-limit until 15 March. The Government's and the applicant's memorials were received at the registry on 19 March. On 17 April, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would reply at the hearing.

After consulting, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government, the Commission's Delegate and the applicant's representative, the President directed on 3 May that the oral hearings should open on 26 June 1984 (Rule 38). On 24 November 1983, he had granted to the representative leave to use the Danish language on this occasion (Rule 27 para. 3). On 30 May, the Registrar, acting on the instructions of the President, requested the Commission and the Government to produce certain documents, which were received on 7, 12 and 15 June.

The hearings were held in public on 26 June at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg. Immediately before they opened, the Court had held a preparatory meeting. There appeared before the Court:

for the Government Mr. T. Lehmann, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Agent, Mr. T. Melchior, Ministry of Justice, Counsel, Mr. J. Bernhard, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. B. Vesterdorf, Ministry of Justice, Advisers;

for the Commission Mr. T. Opsahl, Delegate;

for the applicant Mrs. J. Lindgård, advokat, Counsels The Court heard addresses by Mr. Lehmann and Mr. Melchior for the Government, by Mr. Opsahl for the Commission and by Mrs. Lindgård for the applicant, as well as replies to its questions.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, Mr. Per Krohn Rasmussen, is a Danish citizen, born in 1945. He currently works as a clerk and resides in Nyborg. He was married in 1966. During the marriage, two children were born, a boy in 1966 and a girl, Pernille, on 20 January 1971. The applicant had grounds, even before the latter's birth, for assuming that another man might be the father; however, in order to save the marriage, he took no steps to have paternity determined.

In June 1973, Mr. Rasmussen and his wife applied for a separation (separation ved bevilling), which they obtained on 9 August. In accordance with their agreement, Mrs. Rasmussen retained custody of the children and the competent authority issued a decision to the effect that Mr. Rasmussen should pay maintenance for them from 1 September 1973. He in fact did so from that date until 1 June 1975.

In March 1975, the applicant, who had previously still nurtured hopes of preserving the marriage, took some steps to institute proceedings to challenge his paternity of Pernille. To this end, he applied for legal aid. However, he did not pursue the matter since, on 28 April 1975, he and his wife signed an agreement whereby she waived all claims for maintenance for the child and he undertook to refrain from bringing any such proceedings.

In June 1975, the applicant and his wife applied for a divorce (skilmisse ved bevilling), which was granted on 16 July. On this occasion, he reaffirmed before the authorities that the mother should have sole custody of the children and was once more ordered to pay maintenance for them. He did not raise any objection.

On 16 January 1976, four days before Pernille's fifth birthday, the applicant's former wife wrote to him asserting that she was not bound by the agreement of 28 April 1975. She later lodged with the public authorities a renewed petition for maintenance, which was granted by order effective from 1 March 1976. Since then, Mr. Rasmussen has regularly paid the maintenance.

On 27 January 1976, Mr. Rasmussen sought leave from the Eastern Court of Appeal (Østre Landsret) to institute proceedings out of time to determine the paternity of the girl (see paragraph 19 below). In accordance with the normal procedure, the police, at the Court of Appeal's request, interviewed Mr. Rasmussen and his former wife in March 1976 and recorded their statements in a report.

The Court of Appeal refused the application on 12 April 1976, for the reason that the statutory conditions for granting leave at that time were not satisfied (see paragraph 19 below). The applicant did not appeal against the decision within the statutory time-limit. However, on 27 July 1976, he petitioned the Ministry of Justice for leave to appeal out of time to the Supreme Court (Højesteret), but this was refused on 3 September 1976.

On 20 November 1978, Mr. Rasmussen applied again to the Court of Appeal for leave to institute paternity proceedings. His former wife opposed the application, on the ground that such proceedings would have a detrimental effect on the child. By a decision of 11 December 1978, the Court of Appeal refused the application for the reason that the applicant had not brought the action contesting paternity within the time-limits provided for in section 5(2) of the 1960 Act on the Legal Status of Children (“the 1960 Act“ - Lov nr. 200 af 18.5.1960 om børns retsstilling; see paragraph 19 below) and that there was no cause to grant him any exemption since the conditions laid down in section 5(3) were not met. A similar decision was given by the Supreme Court on 12 January 1979.","{'applicant': 'Per Krohn Rasmussen', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 93], 'countries': 'DNK', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1984}",001-57563

In March 1975, the applicant, who had previously still nurtured hopes of preserving the marriage, took some steps to institute proceedings to challenge his paternity of Pernille. To this end, he applied for legal aid. However, he did not pursue the matter since, on 28 April 1975, he and his wife signed an agreement whereby she waived all claims for maintenance for the child and he undertook to refrain from bringing any such proceedings.

In June 1975, the applicant and his wife applied for a divorce (skilmisse ved bevilling), which was granted on 16 July. On this occasion, he reaffirmed before the authorities that the mother should have sole custody of the children and was once more ordered to pay maintenance for them. He did not raise any objection.

On 16 January 1976, four days before Pernille's fifth birthday, the applicant's former wife wrote to him asserting that she was not bound by the agreement of 28 April 1975. She later lodged with the public authorities a renewed petition for maintenance, which was granted by order effective from 1 March 1976. Since then, Mr. Rasmussen has regularly paid the maintenance.

On 27 January 1976, Mr. Rasmussen sought leave from the Eastern Court of Appeal (Østre Landsret) to institute proceedings out of time to determine the paternity of the girl (see paragraph 19 below). In accordance with the normal procedure, the police, at the Court of Appeal's request, interviewed Mr. Rasmussen and his former wife in March 1976 and recorded their statements in a report.

The Court of Appeal refused the application on 12 April 1976, for the reason that the statutory conditions for granting leave at that time were not satisfied (see paragraph 19 below). The applicant did not appeal against the decision within the statutory time-limit. However, on 27 July 1976, he petitioned the Ministry of Justice for leave to appeal out of time to the Supreme Court (Højesteret), but this was refused on 3 September 1976.

On 20 November 1978, Mr. Rasmussen applied again to the Court of Appeal for leave to institute paternity proceedings. His former wife opposed the application, on the ground that such proceedings would have a detrimental effect on the child. By a decision of 11 December 1978, the Court of Appeal refused the application for the reason that the applicant had not brought the action contesting paternity within the time-limits provided for in section 5(2) of the 1960 Act on the Legal Status of Children (“the 1960 Act“ - Lov nr. 200 af 18.5.1960 om børns retsstilling; see paragraph 19 below) and that there was no cause to grant him any exemption since the conditions laid down in section 5(3) were not met. A similar decision was given by the Supreme Court on 12 January 1979.","{'applicant': 'Per Krohn Rasmussen', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 93], 'countries': 'DNK', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1984}",001-57563

The case originated in an application (no. 35394/97) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Sultan Khan (“the applicant”), a United Kingdom national, on 1 January 1997.

On 3 December 1997 the Commission (First Chamber) decided to give notice of the application to the United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) and invited them to submit observations on its admissibility and merits.

The Government submitted their observations on 2 March 1998. The applicant replied on 30 September 1998, after an extension of the time-limit fixed for that purpose. On 16 October 1998 the Government made comments on the applicant's observations in reply.

Following the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention on 1 November 1998, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 § 2 thereof, the case was examined by the Court.

In accordance with Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the case to the Third Section.

On 24 April 1999 the Court declared the application admissible and decided to invite the parties to a hearing on the merits.

On 7 July 1999 the President granted leave to the non-governmental organisations Justice and Liberty to submit joint written comments in connection with the case (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 61 § 3).

The hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 26 October 1999. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr C. Whomersley, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Lord Williams of Mostyn QC, Attorney-General, Mr J. Crow, Counsel, Ms R. Collins-Rice, Ms K. Jones, Advisers; (b) for the applicant Mr B. Emmerson, Mr K. Starmer, Counsel, Mr J. Dickinson, of the Sheffield Bar, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr Emmerson and Lord Williams.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

On 17 September 1992 the applicant arrived at Manchester Airport on a flight from Pakistan. On the same flight was his cousin, N. Both men were stopped and searched by customs officials. N. was found to be in possession of heroin with a street value of almost 100,000 pounds sterling. He was interviewed and then arrested and charged. No drugs were found on the applicant. He too was interviewed, but made no admissions. He was released without charge. On 26 January 1993 the applicant visited a friend, B., in Sheffield. B. was under investigation for dealing in heroin. On 12 January 1993 the installation of a listening device on B.'s premises had been authorised by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire on the grounds that the conventional methods of surveillance were unlikely to provide proof that he was dealing in drugs. It was not expected or foreseen that the applicant would visit the premises. Neither B. nor the applicant was aware of the aural surveillance equipment which had been installed by the police.

By means of that device the police obtained a tape recording of a conversation, in the course of which the applicant admitted that he had been a party to the importation of drugs by N. on 17 September 1992. The applicant was arrested on 11 February 1993. Again he made no admissions when interviewed, but subsequently he and N. were jointly charged with offences under the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 and the Misuse of Drugs Act 1991 and committed for trial.

The trial took place in December 1993. The applicant pleaded “not guilty”. The applicant admitted that he had been present at the Sheffield address and that his voice was one of those recorded on the tape. It was admitted on behalf of the Crown that the attachment of the listening device had involved a civil trespass and had occasioned some damage to the property. Thereupon, the trial judge conducted a hearing on the voir dire (submissions on a point of law in the absence of the jury) as to the admissibility in evidence of the conversation recorded on the tape. The Crown accepted that without it there was no case against the applicant.

The trial judge ruled that the evidence was admissible. Following an amendment to the indictment, the applicant was re-arraigned and pleaded guilty to being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition on the importation of heroin. On 14 March 1994 the applicant was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.

The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground that the evidence ought to have been held to be inadmissible. On 27 May 1994 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal against conviction but also certified, as a point of law of general public importance, the question whether evidence of tape-recorded conversations, obtained by a listening device attached by the police to a private house without the knowledge of the owners or occupiers, was admissible in a criminal trial against the defendant.

On 4 October 1994 the Appeal Committee of the House of Lords granted the applicant leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal dismissing his appeal against conviction. On 2 July 1996 the House of Lords dismissed the applicant's appeal. The House of Lords noted that the question before it gave rise to two separate issues, the first being whether evidence of the taped conversations was admissible at all and the second whether, if admissible, it should nonetheless have been excluded by the trial judge in the exercise of his discretion at common law or under the powers conferred by section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (“PACE”). As to the former issue, the House of Lords held that there was no right to privacy in English law and that, even if there were such a right, the common-law rule that relevant evidence which was obtained improperly or even unlawfully remained admissible applied to evidence obtained by the use of surveillance devices which invaded a person's privacy. As to the latter issue, it was held that the fact that evidence had been obtained in circumstances which amounted to a breach of the provisions of Article 8 of the Convention was relevant to, but not determinative of, the judge's discretion to admit or exclude such evidence under section 78 of PACE. The judge's discretion had to be exercised according to whether the admission of the evidence would render the trial unfair, and the use at a criminal trial of material obtained in breach of the right to privacy enshrined in Article 8 did not mean that the trial would be unfair. On the facts, the trial judge had been entitled to hold that the circumstances in which the relevant evidence was obtained, even if they constituted a breach of Article 8, were not such as to require the exclusion of the evidence. Lord Nolan, giving the opinion of the majority of the House, added: “The sole cause of this case coming to your Lordship's House is the lack of a statutory system regulating the use of surveillance devices by the police. The absence of such a system seems astonishing, the more so in view of the statutory framework which has governed the use of such devices by the Security Service since 1989, and the interception of communications by the police as well as by other agencies since 1985. I would refrain from other comment because counsel for the respondent was able to inform us, on instructions, that the government proposes to introduce legislation covering the matter in the next session of Parliament.”

The applicant was discharged from prison on 11 August 1994. His release was on licence until 12 May 1995.","{'applicant': 'Sultan Khan', 'articles': [91, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2000}",001-58841

The absence of such a system seems astonishing, the more so in view of the statutory framework which has governed the use of such devices by the Security Service since 1989, and the interception of communications by the police as well as by other agencies since 1985. I would refrain from other comment because counsel for the respondent was able to inform us, on instructions, that the government proposes to introduce legislation covering the matter in the next session of Parliament.”

The applicant was discharged from prison on 11 August 1994. His release was on licence until 12 May 1995.","{'applicant': 'Sultan Khan', 'articles': [91, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2000}",001-58841

The case originated in an application (no. 36042/97) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission on Human Rights (“the Commission”) under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr Kevin David Willis (“the applicant”), on 24 April 1997.

The applicant was represented by Mr S. Wright, a legal officer with the Child Poverty Action Group, London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley.

The applicant alleged that British social-security legislation discriminated against him and his late wife on grounds of sex, in breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with both Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

By a decision of 11 May 1999 the Chamber declared the application admissible [Note by the Registry. The Court's decision is obtainable from the Registry].

On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections. This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant is a British national born in 1956 and living in Bristol.

In December 1984 the applicant married Marlene Willis. They had two children: Natasha Uma, born on 24 March 1989, and Ross Amal, born on 2 August 1990. Mrs Willis died of cancer on 7 June 1996, at the age of 39. The applicant is the administrator of his late wife's estate.

Mrs Willis had been employed as a local authority housing officer. For the greater part of her married life, she was the primary breadwinner. She had paid full social-security contributions as an employed earner until 1994, and was subsequently entitled to contribution credits as a person unfit for work. On 3 November 1995 the applicant gave up work to nurse his wife and care for their children. Following his wife's death, he worked part time between 2 September 1996 and 6 November 1996, for an annual salary of 4,393 pounds sterling (GBP), but since this proved uneconomic he stopped working to care full time for the children.

On 4 November 1996 the applicant applied to the Benefits Agency for the payment of social-security benefits. He applied for benefits equivalent to those which a widow whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of Mrs Willis would have been entitled, namely a widow's payment and a widowed mother's allowance, payable under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992.

By a letter dated 18 November 1996, the Benefits Agency informed the applicant that the benefits he had claimed did not exist for widowers, and that his claim accordingly could not be accepted as valid. The letter continued: “I am afraid I can only explain that the Government says that it has no plans to introduce a widowers' pension on the same line as the existing widows' benefits. It may help if I explain the current policy underlying widows' benefits was established at a time when married women rarely worked. It is based on the assumption that women are more likely than men to have been financially dependent on their spouse's earnings and therefore more likely on widowhood to face greater financial hardship. The benefits themselves are concentrated on those widows who are perceived to have the greatest problems, those with children and older women who may have been out of the labour market for many years. It is accepted that social patterns have changed considerably since the provisions were first introduced. However, it is still broadly the case that on bereavement, women are more likely than men to be in financial need. For instance, most widowers of working age will have been in employment before the death of their wives. They will not therefore have the same degree of difficulty in supporting themselves as widows who may have been out of the labour market for some time and may find it difficult to obtain paid work. Women on average earn less than men. So even for women who have been working, the financial loss on widowhood is likely to be significantly more than for men. Widows' benefits are not means tested and are paid regardless of the level of the widows' earnings. The Government says that the extension of the benefits on the same basis to widowers would mean substantial extra expenditure in paying maintenance benefit to men who are likely to be already maintaining themselves by their earnings, and in some cases, very high earnings indeed. To make existing widows' benefits provisions available to widowers would add an estimated GBP 490 million to the annual Social Security budget. The Government is of the opinion that at a time when all areas of public expenditure are having to be carefully considered, this is simply not a best use of scarce resources. In making these points, the Government says that it is in no way minimising the sad problems faced by widowers, in particular those left with small children to care for. For them there are already available benefits such as Child Benefit and One Parent Benefit, together with the range of income-related benefits, for example, Income Support for those not in full time work and Family Credit for low paid workers. In the Government's view this remains the fairest way of providing benefits to meet specific need rather than an extension of widows' benefits along the lines suggested. ...”

The applicant lodged a statutory appeal against this decision on 17 February 1997. The Social Security Appeal Tribunal declined jurisdiction on the basis that no appealable decision had been made.

The applicant currently receives child benefit and, in respect of his son Ross, received a disability living allowance and an invalid care allowance for a period following his wife's death. He is also in receipt of a widower's pension under Mrs Willis's occupational pension scheme. The applicant has capital, much of which is derived from a joint endowment policy (for which he and Mrs Willis had paid premiums) which matured on Mrs Willis's death, from which he obtains a further income of about GBP 150 per month. Because of his savings, the applicant does not qualify for means-tested benefits such as income support or family credit. All the social-security benefits he receives would also be received by a widow, who would in addition be paid a widow's payment and a widowed mother's allowance.

COMPLAINTS

The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities' refusal to pay him the social-security benefits to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely a widowed mother's allowance and a widow's payment, constituted discrimination against him and his wife on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with each of Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. He made an identical complaint as regards his future non-entitlement to a widow's pension. He complained also of a violation of Article 13 of the Convention.","{'applicant': 'Kevin David Willis', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2002}",001-60499

In December 1984 the applicant married Marlene Willis. They had two children: Natasha Uma, born on 24 March 1989, and Ross Amal, born on 2 August 1990. Mrs Willis died of cancer on 7 June 1996, at the age of 39. The applicant is the administrator of his late wife's estate.

Mrs Willis had been employed as a local authority housing officer. For the greater part of her married life, she was the primary breadwinner. She had paid full social-security contributions as an employed earner until 1994, and was subsequently entitled to contribution credits as a person unfit for work. On 3 November 1995 the applicant gave up work to nurse his wife and care for their children. Following his wife's death, he worked part time between 2 September 1996 and 6 November 1996, for an annual salary of 4,393 pounds sterling (GBP), but since this proved uneconomic he stopped working to care full time for the children.

On 4 November 1996 the applicant applied to the Benefits Agency for the payment of social-security benefits. He applied for benefits equivalent to those which a widow whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of Mrs Willis would have been entitled, namely a widow's payment and a widowed mother's allowance, payable under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992.

By a letter dated 18 November 1996, the Benefits Agency informed the applicant that the benefits he had claimed did not exist for widowers, and that his claim accordingly could not be accepted as valid. The letter continued: “I am afraid I can only explain that the Government says that it has no plans to introduce a widowers' pension on the same line as the existing widows' benefits. It may help if I explain the current policy underlying widows' benefits was established at a time when married women rarely worked. It is based on the assumption that women are more likely than men to have been financially dependent on their spouse's earnings and therefore more likely on widowhood to face greater financial hardship. The benefits themselves are concentrated on those widows who are perceived to have the greatest problems, those with children and older women who may have been out of the labour market for many years. It is accepted that social patterns have changed considerably since the provisions were first introduced. However, it is still broadly the case that on bereavement, women are more likely than men to be in financial need. For instance, most widowers of working age will have been in employment before the death of their wives. They will not therefore have the same degree of difficulty in supporting themselves as widows who may have been out of the labour market for some time and may find it difficult to obtain paid work. Women on average earn less than men. So even for women who have been working, the financial loss on widowhood is likely to be significantly more than for men. Widows' benefits are not means tested and are paid regardless of the level of the widows' earnings. The Government says that the extension of the benefits on the same basis to widowers would mean substantial extra expenditure in paying maintenance benefit to men who are likely to be already maintaining themselves by their earnings, and in some cases, very high earnings indeed. To make existing widows' benefits provisions available to widowers would add an estimated GBP 490 million to the annual Social Security budget. The Government is of the opinion that at a time when all areas of public expenditure are having to be carefully considered, this is simply not a best use of scarce resources. In making these points, the Government says that it is in no way minimising the sad problems faced by widowers, in particular those left with small children to care for. For them there are already available benefits such as Child Benefit and One Parent Benefit, together with the range of income-related benefits, for example, Income Support for those not in full time work and Family Credit for low paid workers. In the Government's view this remains the fairest way of providing benefits to meet specific need rather than an extension of widows' benefits along the lines suggested. ...”

The applicant lodged a statutory appeal against this decision on 17 February 1997. The Social Security Appeal Tribunal declined jurisdiction on the basis that no appealable decision had been made.

The applicant currently receives child benefit and, in respect of his son Ross, received a disability living allowance and an invalid care allowance for a period following his wife's death. He is also in receipt of a widower's pension under Mrs Willis's occupational pension scheme. The applicant has capital, much of which is derived from a joint endowment policy (for which he and Mrs Willis had paid premiums) which matured on Mrs Willis's death, from which he obtains a further income of about GBP 150 per month. Because of his savings, the applicant does not qualify for means-tested benefits such as income support or family credit. All the social-security benefits he receives would also be received by a widow, who would in addition be paid a widow's payment and a widowed mother's allowance.

COMPLAINTS

The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities' refusal to pay him the social-security benefits to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely a widowed mother's allowance and a widow's payment, constituted discrimination against him and his wife on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with each of Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. He made an identical complaint as regards his future non-entitlement to a widow's pension. He complained also of a violation of Article 13 of the Convention.","{'applicant': 'Kevin David Willis', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 52, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2002}",001-60499

The case originated in an application (no. 42341/04) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr Manmohan Bhandari (“the applicant”), on 18 November 2004. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J Grainger, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

On 13 December 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1934 and lives in the Isle of Man. He grew raspberries there and had a lucrative contract with the shop Marks and Spencers, but lost it in 1990 when the local environmental health officer let it be known to the shop that the applicant was packing raspberries in his kitchen. The applicant and his wife sued the Department of Local Government and the Environment ('DOLGE') for mis-statement and were awarded over GBP 16,000 in damages by the Manx High Court on 1 April 1993. The applicant did not consider that this was enough, and, wishing to appeal, instructed a new (Manx) advocate, a Mr Carter, then a partner in a firm of advocates called Carter Jones McDonald ('CJM'). Mr Carter advised that there was merit in an appeal, and applied for legal aid on his client's behalf in April 1993: this application was rejected on 25 May 1993. The applicant's Petition of Appeal from the first instance judgment was rejected the next day because it had been filed two days late. Mr Carter advised (via letter and at a meeting) that it would not be unduly difficult to apply for an extension of time in which to lodge the appeal, but that, in the circumstances, the best course of action was for the applicant to cut his losses and to accept an offer put forward by DOLGE. The applicant accepted this advice and, on 17 June 1993, DOLGE's offer of GBP 20,000.

CJM issued proceedings against the applicant for payment of their fees on 7 December 1993. An advocate instructed by the applicant to defend the claim failed to file a Defence in the prescribed period, and judgment was entered for CJM on 5 January 1994. After taxation of CJM's costs, judgment was issued on 2 March 1995 for a total of GBP 929.80. Mr Carter then applied for execution of the judgment and on 9 October 1995, the applicant's property was placed under arrest by the Coroner. The applicant appealed on 30 October 1995 and on 7 November 1995 Mr Carter wrote to the Coroner and the applicant requesting that no further steps be taken in respect of the enforcement of the execution against the applicant until specifically instructed. It appears that the execution remained suspended until the judgment of 17 November 2003 detailed below.

After a delay occasioned by their difficulty in obtaining legal aid, the applicant and his wife brought proceedings on 26 March 1996 against CJM in negligence, claiming that CJM's actions and omissions in April-June 1993 had deprived them of the opportunity to pursue their appeal against the first instance decision in their case against DOLGE. These proceedings are referred to hereafter as “the CJM proceedings.” In them, the applicant and his wife were represented throughout by leading Counsel from England, who had been granted a special temporary licence as a Manx advocate. The proceedings were heard by Acting Deemster Hall, succeeded by Acting Deemster Newey.

The summons issued on 26 March 1996 was not served on CJM until 20 March 1998, the time for service of the summons having been extended by the High Court on 27 February 1997. After the applicant filed a motion for judgment in default of defence on 22 June 1998, it appears a first defence was served out of time on 7 July 1998. A second defence was served on 16 September 1998. After the service of this second defence, a motion filed by the applicant for judgment in default was dismissed by consent on 17 September 1998. On 25 January 1999 the defendants filed a motion for a split trial between liability and quantum issues, which was dismissed on 25 October 2000. It appears that there had been no correspondence between the parties and the High Court between 27 July 1999 and 6 January 2000, leading the High Court to write to the defendants on 26 January 2000 indicating, inter alia, that Acting Deemster Hall “was very anxious to progress the matter”. After the dismissal of the defendant's motion for a split trial on 25 October 2000, it appears it was incumbent on the applicant to apply to have the case set down for trial within 28 days of this date. No application was made. On 12 January 2001, the High Court wrote to the applicant's solicitors requesting that they make the necessary application as soon as possible. On 19 January 2001, the applicant's solicitors replied, apologising for the delay in their application. On 22 January 2001, the High Court replied with instructions from the Acting Deemster that the case be set down for trial within 28 days. Both parties responded expressing concern at this proposal. It further appears that throughout 2001 the parties each filed a number of motions, the defendants requesting a stay in the proceedings and each seeking leave to amend the statement of case, the defence and reply. Further such motions were sought throughout 2002 and January and February 2003. On 31 October 2002 and 12 February 2003, the High Court made orders setting further directions for the proceedings. Further orders were agreed by consent between the parties on 21 June 2001, 1 February 2002 and 17 July 2002, in each instance agreeing to a revised timetable and date for trial. On 20 December 2002 the applicant issued a motion for additional time to serve a further expert report to which the defendants responded with a motion that the action be struck out for non-compliance with orders of the High Court. In order to hear the motions, the High Court vacated the scheduled trial date. They were heard on 12 February 2003 with the defendant's motion being dismissed, the applicant being given leave to serve the expert report and further directions being given to the parties.

The CJM proceedings did not therefore come to trial before Acting Deemster Newey until 21 March 2003, at which point CJM essentially conceded liability and limited themselves to contesting quantum. By a judgment dated 17 November 2003: (1) the judgments obtained by CJM in 1995 were set aside (by consent) and these earlier proceedings dismissed; and (2) the applicant and his wife were awarded the sum of GBP 10,780.93 plus interest of GBP 8,567.13.

The applicant and his wife appealed against the quantum of the award; their appeal was dismissed on 25 May 2004. In a detailed 37 page judgment, the High Court of Justice of the Isle of Man (Staff Government Division) considered and dismissed each head of their challenge to the conclusions of the first instance judge. It seems that the applicant's Counsel was directed by the lead judge at the end of the hearing that his interest was now at end.

The applicant wished to apply to the Privy Council for special leave to appeal directly to the Council but it appears that after failing to obtain such leave as a “poor person” and failing to obtain legal aid from the Manx authorities, he did not do so.","{'applicant': 'Manmohan Bhandari', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2007}",001-82501

The summons issued on 26 March 1996 was not served on CJM until 20 March 1998, the time for service of the summons having been extended by the High Court on 27 February 1997. After the applicant filed a motion for judgment in default of defence on 22 June 1998, it appears a first defence was served out of time on 7 July 1998. A second defence was served on 16 September 1998. After the service of this second defence, a motion filed by the applicant for judgment in default was dismissed by consent on 17 September 1998. On 25 January 1999 the defendants filed a motion for a split trial between liability and quantum issues, which was dismissed on 25 October 2000. It appears that there had been no correspondence between the parties and the High Court between 27 July 1999 and 6 January 2000, leading the High Court to write to the defendants on 26 January 2000 indicating, inter alia, that Acting Deemster Hall “was very anxious to progress the matter”. After the dismissal of the defendant's motion for a split trial on 25 October 2000, it appears it was incumbent on the applicant to apply to have the case set down for trial within 28 days of this date. No application was made. On 12 January 2001, the High Court wrote to the applicant's solicitors requesting that they make the necessary application as soon as possible. On 19 January 2001, the applicant's solicitors replied, apologising for the delay in their application. On 22 January 2001, the High Court replied with instructions from the Acting Deemster that the case be set down for trial within 28 days. Both parties responded expressing concern at this proposal. It further appears that throughout 2001 the parties each filed a number of motions, the defendants requesting a stay in the proceedings and each seeking leave to amend the statement of case, the defence and reply. Further such motions were sought throughout 2002 and January and February 2003. On 31 October 2002 and 12 February 2003, the High Court made orders setting further directions for the proceedings. Further orders were agreed by consent between the parties on 21 June 2001, 1 February 2002 and 17 July 2002, in each instance agreeing to a revised timetable and date for trial. On 20 December 2002 the applicant issued a motion for additional time to serve a further expert report to which the defendants responded with a motion that the action be struck out for non-compliance with orders of the High Court. In order to hear the motions, the High Court vacated the scheduled trial date. They were heard on 12 February 2003 with the defendant's motion being dismissed, the applicant being given leave to serve the expert report and further directions being given to the parties.

The CJM proceedings did not therefore come to trial before Acting Deemster Newey until 21 March 2003, at which point CJM essentially conceded liability and limited themselves to contesting quantum. By a judgment dated 17 November 2003: (1) the judgments obtained by CJM in 1995 were set aside (by consent) and these earlier proceedings dismissed; and (2) the applicant and his wife were awarded the sum of GBP 10,780.93 plus interest of GBP 8,567.13.

The applicant and his wife appealed against the quantum of the award; their appeal was dismissed on 25 May 2004. In a detailed 37 page judgment, the High Court of Justice of the Isle of Man (Staff Government Division) considered and dismissed each head of their challenge to the conclusions of the first instance judge. It seems that the applicant's Counsel was directed by the lead judge at the end of the hearing that his interest was now at end.

The applicant wished to apply to the Privy Council for special leave to appeal directly to the Council but it appears that after failing to obtain such leave as a “poor person” and failing to obtain legal aid from the Manx authorities, he did not do so.","{'applicant': 'Manmohan Bhandari', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2007}",001-82501

The case originated in an application (no. 42341/04) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr Manmohan Bhandari (“the applicant”), on 18 November 2004. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J Grainger, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

On 13 December 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1934 and lives in the Isle of Man. He grew raspberries there and had a lucrative contract with the shop Marks and Spencers, but lost it in 1990 when the local environmental health officer let it be known to the shop that the applicant was packing raspberries in his kitchen. The applicant and his wife sued the Department of Local Government and the Environment ('DOLGE') for mis-statement and were awarded over GBP 16,000 in damages by the Manx High Court on 1 April 1993. The applicant did not consider that this was enough, and, wishing to appeal, instructed a new (Manx) advocate, a Mr Carter, then a partner in a firm of advocates called Carter Jones McDonald ('CJM'). Mr Carter advised that there was merit in an appeal, and applied for legal aid on his client's behalf in April 1993: this application was rejected on 25 May 1993. The applicant's Petition of Appeal from the first instance judgment was rejected the next day because it had been filed two days late. Mr Carter advised (via letter and at a meeting) that it would not be unduly difficult to apply for an extension of time in which to lodge the appeal, but that, in the circumstances, the best course of action was for the applicant to cut his losses and to accept an offer put forward by DOLGE. The applicant accepted this advice and, on 17 June 1993, DOLGE's offer of GBP 20,000.

CJM issued proceedings against the applicant for payment of their fees on 7 December 1993. An advocate instructed by the applicant to defend the claim failed to file a Defence in the prescribed period, and judgment was entered for CJM on 5 January 1994. After taxation of CJM's costs, judgment was issued on 2 March 1995 for a total of GBP 929.80. Mr Carter then applied for execution of the judgment and on 9 October 1995, the applicant's property was placed under arrest by the Coroner. The applicant appealed on 30 October 1995 and on 7 November 1995 Mr Carter wrote to the Coroner and the applicant requesting that no further steps be taken in respect of the enforcement of the execution against the applicant until specifically instructed. It appears that the execution remained suspended until the judgment of 17 November 2003 detailed below.

After a delay occasioned by their difficulty in obtaining legal aid, the applicant and his wife brought proceedings on 26 March 1996 against CJM in negligence, claiming that CJM's actions and omissions in April-June 1993 had deprived them of the opportunity to pursue their appeal against the first instance decision in their case against DOLGE. These proceedings are referred to hereafter as “the CJM proceedings.” In them, the applicant and his wife were represented throughout by leading Counsel from England, who had been granted a special temporary licence as a Manx advocate. The proceedings were heard by Acting Deemster Hall, succeeded by Acting Deemster Newey.

The summons issued on 26 March 1996 was not served on CJM until 20 March 1998, the time for service of the summons having been extended by the High Court on 27 February 1997. After the applicant filed a motion for judgment in default of defence on 22 June 1998, it appears a first defence was served out of time on 7 July 1998. A second defence was served on 16 September 1998. After the service of this second defence, a motion filed by the applicant for judgment in default was dismissed by consent on 17 September 1998. On 25 January 1999 the defendants filed a motion for a split trial between liability and quantum issues, which was dismissed on 25 October 2000.

469,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 56811/00) against the Kingdom of Denmark lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Iranian national, Davood Amrollahi (“the applicant”), on 3 March 2000.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr Jørgen Lange, a lawyer practising in Copenhagen. The Danish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Hans Klingenberg, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The applicant complained under Article 8 of the Convention that, as a result of his expulsion from Denmark, he will be separated from his wife and children, who cannot be expected to follow him to Iran.

The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.

The Court decided to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, indicating to the Government that it was desirable in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings not to expel the applicant pending the Court's decision.

By a decision of 28 June 2001 the Court declared the application partly admissible.

After consulting the parties, the Court decided that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2, in fine). The Government filed additional observations concerning exhaustion of national remedies. The applicant filed supplementary information on his present situation.

On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

A. Personal circumstances

The applicant is an Iranian citizen, born in 1966, and lives in Viborg, Denmark.

In 1986 the applicant commenced his military training in Iran. It is not clear whether he participated directly in the war between Iran and Iraq. On 25 April 1987 he deserted and fled to Turkey, where he arrived on 5 May 1987. It appears that the applicant stayed for some time in Turkey and then in Greece.

He arrived in Denmark on 20 August 1989 and applied for asylum. Pursuant to the practice of the Danish immigration authorities at that time, all asylum-seekers from Iran who, due to desertion from the army, had left their home country before the armistice between Iran and Iraq in the summer of 1988 were granted a residence permit. Accordingly, on 12 October 1990 the applicant was granted a residence and work permit. On 25 August 1994 the residence permit became permanent.

In 1992 the applicant met a Danish woman, A, with whom he cohabited. A daughter was born out of the relationship on 16 October 1996. The applicant and A got married on 23 September 1997 and had another child, a son, born on 20 April 2001. A also has a daughter born in 1989 from a previous relationship, who lives with A and the applicant, and with whom the applicant has a very close relationship. All three children have been raised pursuant to Danish traditions.

It appears that the applicant's family broke off all relations with him in 1987 due to his desertion from the army.

In Denmark the applicant had been making a living as the owner of a pizzeria until the end of 1996. Since May 2000 he had been receiving welfare benefits and was at the same time assigned job training by the municipality with the possibility of continuing employment. A works at a retirement home.

B. Proceedings before the domestic authorities

On 17 December 1996 the applicant was arrested and detained on remand, charged with drug trafficking allegedly committed during 1996. By judgment of 1 October 1997 the City Court of Hobro (retten i Hobro) found him guilty, inter alia, of drug trafficking with regard to at least 450 grams of heroine contrary to Article 191 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment and, pursuant to sections 22 and 26 of the Aliens Act, was expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on his return. The applicant appealed against the judgment but withdrew the appeal in November 1997, whereupon the City Court judgment acquired legal force.

On 14 July 1998, pursuant to section 50 of the Aliens Act, the applicant instituted proceedings in the City Court of Hobro claiming that material changes in his circumstances had occurred on account of which he requested the court to review the expulsion order. He referred to his family situation and alleged, with reference to information obtained from Amnesty International, that it could not be ruled out that he would risk severe punishment in Iran for having deserted from the army and also perhaps receive a life sentence for the narcotics crimes committed in Denmark. On 11 September 1998 the City Court rejected the applicant's request, as it did not find that the applicant's situation had changed to such an extent that there was any reason to revoke the expulsion order. This decision was upheld by the High Court of Western Denmark (Vestre Landsret) on 9 October 1998.

On 17 December 1998 the applicant had served two-thirds of his sentence and was due to be released on parole. Since he did not consent to the deportation and refused to leave the country voluntarily, he was detained as from that date in accordance with the Aliens Act with a view to being repatriated. Also in accordance with the Aliens Act, the applicant availed himself of the possibility, prior to the enforcement of a deportation, to bring before the immigration authorities (Udlændingestyrelsen) the question whether he could be returned to Iran, since, pursuant to the Aliens Act, an alien must not be returned to a country in which he or she will risk persecution on the grounds set out in Article 1 A of the Convention of 28 July 1951 concerning the Status of Refugees. The immigration authorities found, on 13 January 1999, that the applicant would not risk persecution in Iran of a kind which could constitute a basis for his remaining in Denmark. The applicant appealed against this decision to the Refugee Board (Flygtningenævnet), which on 16 April 1999 requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide more information on the situation in Iran. Having obtained information from several different authorities, on 4 January 2000 the Refugee Board confirmed the immigration authorities' decision.

Subsequently, relying on section 50 of the Aliens Act for the second time, and claiming that material changes in his circumstances had occurred, the applicant requested the City Court of Hobro to reconsider the expulsion decision. The court had the same material at its disposal as the Refugee Board and a number of statements from doctors concerning the applicant's state of health. In addition, A was heard stating inter alia that her daughter from a previous relationship, refuses to move to Iran. By judgment of 14 February 2000 the City Court revoked the decision to expel the applicant. On 3 March 2000 the High Court of Western Denmark quashed the above decision and dismissed the applicant's request for reconsideration of the expulsion order since, pursuant to section 50 of the Aliens Act, an expelled alien is entitled to only one judicial review of the question of expulsion. The applicant's application for leave to appeal against this decision was granted by the Leave to Appeal Board (Procesbevillingsnævnet) on 5 May 2000. The applicant was released from his detention on 11 May 2000. On 7 September 2000 the Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision of 3 March 2000 as it agreed that a request for a review of an expulsion order pursuant to section 50 of the Aliens Act could only be examined once by the courts.","{'applicant': 'Davood Amrollahi', 'articles': [91, 34, 56, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'DNK', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2002}",001-60605

This decision was upheld by the High Court of Western Denmark (Vestre Landsret) on 9 October 1998.

On 17 December 1998 the applicant had served two-thirds of his sentence and was due to be released on parole. Since he did not consent to the deportation and refused to leave the country voluntarily, he was detained as from that date in accordance with the Aliens Act with a view to being repatriated. Also in accordance with the Aliens Act, the applicant availed himself of the possibility, prior to the enforcement of a deportation, to bring before the immigration authorities (Udlændingestyrelsen) the question whether he could be returned to Iran, since, pursuant to the Aliens Act, an alien must not be returned to a country in which he or she will risk persecution on the grounds set out in Article 1 A of the Convention of 28 July 1951 concerning the Status of Refugees. The immigration authorities found, on 13 January 1999, that the applicant would not risk persecution in Iran of a kind which could constitute a basis for his remaining in Denmark. The applicant appealed against this decision to the Refugee Board (Flygtningenævnet), which on 16 April 1999 requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide more information on the situation in Iran. Having obtained information from several different authorities, on 4 January 2000 the Refugee Board confirmed the immigration authorities' decision.

Subsequently, relying on section 50 of the Aliens Act for the second time, and claiming that material changes in his circumstances had occurred, the applicant requested the City Court of Hobro to reconsider the expulsion decision. The court had the same material at its disposal as the Refugee Board and a number of statements from doctors concerning the applicant's state of health. In addition, A was heard stating inter alia that her daughter from a previous relationship, refuses to move to Iran. By judgment of 14 February 2000 the City Court revoked the decision to expel the applicant. On 3 March 2000 the High Court of Western Denmark quashed the above decision and dismissed the applicant's request for reconsideration of the expulsion order since, pursuant to section 50 of the Aliens Act, an expelled alien is entitled to only one judicial review of the question of expulsion. The applicant's application for leave to appeal against this decision was granted by the Leave to Appeal Board (Procesbevillingsnævnet) on 5 May 2000. The applicant was released from his detention on 11 May 2000. On 7 September 2000 the Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision of 3 March 2000 as it agreed that a request for a review of an expulsion order pursuant to section 50 of the Aliens Act could only be examined once by the courts.","{'applicant': 'Davood Amrollahi', 'articles': [91, 34, 56, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'DNK', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2002}",001-60605

The case originated in an application (no. 60437/08) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Swedish national, Mr Mats Eriksson (“the applicant”), on 13 November 2008.

The applicant was represented by Mr R. Helenius, a lawyer practising in Jönköping. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms G. Isaksson, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

The applicant alleged, in particular, that the administrative courts had failed to hold an oral hearing in proceedings relating to his request for life annuity.

On 2 February 2011 the application was communicated to the Government.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Trosa.

In 1989 the applicant was diagnosed with type II diabetes and vascular spasms. While riding a bicycle on work-related business on 21 January 2000, the applicant suffered a heart attack which caused him to fall. About two weeks later, he also suffered a cerebral stroke. On 2 April 2001 he reported the accident to the Social Insurance Office (Försäkringskassan) of the County of Södermanland which granted him early retirement pension as from 1 December 2001.

The applicant also requested the Social Insurance Office to grant him life annuity (livränta) but, on 28 April 2003, the Social Insurance Office rejected the request. It found that the applicant’s medical problems could not be regarded as work-related and that his ability to support himself by working was not sufficiently reduced as a result of the accident. According to medical opinions given on 6 August and 17 September 2002 by Dr B.M., the Social Insurance Office’s own medical doctor (försäkringsläkare), the main reason for the applicant’s inability to work was diabetes, from which he had suffered for 16 years at the time of the accident, and some other medical conditions from which he suffered and which together had caused the heart attack and the cerebral stroke. According to him, it was not probable that work-related factors, such as stress, had contributed to the deterioration of the applicant’s physical condition.

By letter dated 6 May 2003 the applicant’s legal counsel appealed to the County Administrative Court (länsrätten) of the County of Södermanland, claiming that the applicant had a right to a life annuity since his illnesses had been work-related. At times he had had up to three different jobs, each one of which, had been hectic and thereby created a difficult and very stressful situation. He produced a medical opinion by Dr. C-G.E., dated 5 February 2003, which stated that known risk factors for arteriosclerosis and heart attack were, among other factors, diabetes, smoking and high blood pressure. Recently, the feeling of severe stress, especially over a long period of time, had been shown to be an element that increased the risk of developing heart and vascular disorders as well. The interaction between various risk factors was complex but, in general, the more risk factors were present, the higher the risk of suffering a heart attack or developing vascular disorders. In the applicant’s case, the physician considered that few risk factors were present and that it was highly probable that his stressful work situation had contributed to the heart attack and cerebral stroke.

On 18 March 2004 the County Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s appeal. In reaching its decision, the court had regard to the medical certificates by Dr B.M., which established no link between the work situation and the applicant’s illness, as well as to the medical opinion by Dr. C-G.E. which suggested that there existed such a link. On the basis of these and the parties’ submissions, the court found that the applicant had been exposed to stress in his work but that the causal link between this fact and the applicant’s medical condition could not be established with a sufficiently high degree of probability.

By letter dated 14 April 2004 the applicant, represented by the same legal counsel, appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten) in Stockholm, maintaining his claims. By letter dated 3 February 2005 the applicant submitted to the court a further medical opinion given by Dr E.H. on 23 December 2004 which supported the opinion given by Dr C-G.E.

By letter dated 28 April 2005 the applicant requested that the Administrative Court of Appeal hold an oral hearing in the case without, however, giving any reasons for his request. He repeated the request on 14 June 2005 and specified that he wanted Dr C-G.E., Dr E.H., Dr V.B. and Dr B.M. to be heard before the court about the existence of a causal link between his work and his injury. In another letter, dated 13 September 2005, he invoked Article 6 of the Convention in relation to his right to an oral hearing and clarified that he wanted an oral hearing to deal with his case as a whole, including the question of leave to appeal.

On 23 November 2005 the Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the request for an oral hearing, finding that there was no reason to hold one to decide on the question of leave to appeal. The court asked the applicant to complete his written submissions.

On 31 August 2006 the applicant submitted to the Administrative Court of Appeal a new medical opinion, dated the same day, by Dr P.S. and Dr B.C-D. This medical opinion also supported the opinion given by Dr C‑G.E that there was a causal link between the applicant’s work and his injury. On 12 October 2006 the applicant requested again that an oral hearing be held in the case and that all the medical doctors who had submitted opinions be heard to prove that there was a causal link between his work and his injury. He also wanted to be heard himself about his work situation and the stressful environment.

On 7 February 2007 the Administrative Court of Appeal refused the applicant leave to appeal. It noted that leave to appeal should be granted if it was important for the guidance of the application of law that an appellate court consider the appeal, if reasons existed to amend the lower court’s conclusion, or if there were otherwise extraordinary reasons to entertain the appeal. As the court found that no such grounds were at hand, it refused leave to appeal.

By letter dated 4 April 2007 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsrätten), reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the lower instances and requesting the court either to refer the case back to the Administrative Court of Appeal for an oral hearing or to hold an oral hearing itself. He reiterated that he wanted to be heard himself and also to hear as witnesses the medical doctors whose opinions he had submitted to the court. Having been asked by the court, the applicant specified in his letter dated 10 June 2007 that he wanted the court to hold an oral hearing even if it was for the purpose of deciding whether or not to grant him leave to appeal. He again invoked Article 6 of the Convention.

On 29 October 2007 the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the request for an oral hearing as it found no reason to hold one in order to decide on the question of leave to appeal. The applicant was requested to complete his written submissions.

On 27 May 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court refused the applicant leave to appeal. It noted that leave to appeal was granted if the case was a precedent case or if serious material or procedural mistakes were involved. As this was not so in the present case, the court found no reason to try the case on its merits.","{'applicant': 'Mats Eriksson', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 51, 53, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2012}",001-110322

On 27 May 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court refused the applicant leave to appeal. It noted that leave to appeal was granted if the case was a precedent case or if serious material or procedural mistakes were involved. As this was not so in the present case, the court found no reason to try the case on its merits.","{'applicant': 'Mats Eriksson', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 51, 53, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2012}",001-110322

The case originated in an application (no. 55434/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr John Boyle (“the applicant”), on 25 February 2000.

The applicant was represented by Mr J. Mackenzie, a lawyer practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Grainger of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant alleged that his detention on remand pending his trial by court martial was in breach of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.

By a decision of 25 October 2005, the Court declared the application admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed further written observations (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine), the parties replied in writing to each other's observations.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in London.

The applicant joined the British Army in 1990. In 1999 he was serving as a gunner with the 12th Regiment of the Royal Artillery and was stationed in Germany.

On 1 November 1999 a woman alleged that she had been raped and on 2 November the applicant was arrested, along with two other soldiers, by the service police. The service police interviewed the applicant on 4 November 1999 and it appears that he was assisted by a lieutenant from Army Legal Services. On that date he also signed a certificate acknowledging that he had been informed of his right to have the assistance of an “accused advisor” during any summary hearing before his commanding officer (“CO”).

On 5 November 1999 he was charged by his CO, pursuant to section 70 of the Army Act 1955 (“the 1955 Act”), with indecent assault contrary to section 14(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. It appears that his two co-accused were charged with rape. The charge was read; the CO said that the matter was to be referred to a higher authority given the seriousness of the charge; the applicant was asked if he had anything to say and he replied that he had not. He was given a four-page document immediately before that hearing, which document was taken back from him immediately thereafter.

A certificate dated 6 November 1999 and signed by the applicant has been submitted: it confirms that the applicant received the pamphlet “The Rights of a Soldier Charged with an Offence under the Army Act 1955” and that he had had the opportunity to be advised by an officer of his choice. On the same date, the CO referred the case to the Higher Authority and remanded the applicant in close arrest. A short note by the CO (“referred to Higher Authority”) constitutes the sole record before the Court of that hearing.

On 16 November 1999 the applicant was transferred to the Military Correctional Training Centre (“the MCTC”) in the United Kingdom.

Twelve “8-day delay” reports were completed during the applicant's pre-trial detention. The first, dated 12 November 1999, was signed by his CO in the 12th Regiment of the Royal Artillery and the reasons for detention were recorded as being “undesirable that he should remain at [large]”. All subsequent reports (dated 19 November, 25 November, 3 December, 13 December, 20 December and 29 December 1999 and dated 4 January, 12 January, 20 January, 28 January and 7 February 2000) were signed by the CO of the MCTC and recorded two reasons for his continued detention: it was considered that he was likely to suborn witnesses and that, given the “nature and prevalence of the alleged offence under investigation” it was “undesirable in the interests of discipline that he should be at large or consort with his comrades.” The final report dated 7 February 2000 recorded for the first time an additional charge against the applicant pursuant to section 70 of the 1955 Act: rape contrary to section 1(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956.

Six “16-day arrest” forms were also completed (pursuant to Rule 22 of the Investigation and Summary Dealing (Army) Regulations 1997) on 19 November, 3 December and 20 December 1999 and on 4 January, 20 January and 7 February 2000. The CO of the MCTC signed these forms and recorded that the applicant had been brought before him to consider any representations the applicant may have had concerning his arrest status and that he had been informed of his right to apply to the military authorities for his release. No representations from the applicant were recorded as having been made. No reasons were noted as to why the applicant had been detained except in the last form (dated 7 February 2000) which recorded the same reasons as in the above-noted 8-day reports namely: “He is likely to suborn witnesses. Having regard to the nature or prevalence of the offence under investigation it is undesirable in the interests of discipline that he should be at large or consort with his comrades.”

A Special Report form dated 4 January 2000 (relating to detention beyond the seventy-second day which would fall on 13 January 2000) also recorded that the applicant was likely to suborn witnesses and that it was undesirable in the interests of discipline that he be allowed to consort with his comrades due to the seriousness of the alleged offence. A Special Report, dated 10 January 2000 and completed by a lieutenant colonel (chief of staff) of Headquarters Land Command, recorded that approval had been given for the continued detention of the applicant on the grounds that he was a habitual absentee and was likely to absent himself again if released. Headquarters was to be informed if he had not been brought to trial by 14 February 2000.

On 12 January 2000 a solicitor was instructed by the applicant's parents. On 13 January 2000 that solicitor took instructions from the applicant. The latter alleged that the accused advisor had taken no part in the review procedures.

On 14 January 2000 his solicitor requested the military authorities to provide copies of the relevant documentation concerning the applicant's detention. By letter dated 11 February 2000 the acting brigade commander of the 16th Air Assault Brigade sent the above-described reports to the applicant's solicitor.

On 1 February 2000 his solicitor sought a review of the applicant's detention by the general officer commanding 4th Division. He was initially orally informed that the review would take place on 15 February 2000 but was then informed on 16 February 2000 that the review had not taken place.

On 18 February 2000 the applicant's representative applied for a writ of habeas corpus to the High Court. A return date was fixed for 3 March 2000. The application was served on the CO of the MCTC on 19 February 2000.

On 22 February 2000 the CO of the MCTC released the applicant from close arrest and he was posted to the 47th Regiment Royal Artillery.

On 2 March 2000, the same CO swore an affidavit setting out the reasons for the applicant's release. He stated: 'I decided, on balance, following a thorough review of the Applicant's case, that the interests of justice could be met by releasing the Applicant into open arrest even though the allegation against him was that he had committed rape and indecent assault...and despite the fact that there was evidence that he, with others, concocted a story and interfered with a witness. I decided that the Applicant should be posted with immediate effect to a different unit in a different country namely the UK, and issued with specific orders preventing him from being able to influence the witnesses.'

The applicant and his two co-defendants were tried by Army General Court Martial on a joint charge of rape between 14 May and 25 May 2001. All three defendants were acquitted.","{'applicant': 'John Boyle', 'articles': [91, 34, 53, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-84285

The case originated in an application (no. 26891/95) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Finnish national, Antero Lagerblom (“the applicant”), on 2 January 1995.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr I. Salmi, a lawyer practising in Gothenburg. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms I. Kalmerborn, Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

The applicant alleged, in particular, that his rights under Article 6 of the Convention had been violated in criminal proceedings against him, as he had not been given a Finnish-speaking public defence counsel.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.

By a decision of 15 February 2000 the Court declared the application admissible.

The Government, but not the applicant, filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine), the applicant replied in writing to the Government’s observations.

On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, who was born in 1942, settled in Sweden in the second half of the 1980s. His mother tongue is Finnish.

On 3 December 1991 the applicant was charged before the District Court (tingsrätten) of Gothenburg with aggravated drunken driving and driving without a driver’s licence. According to the record of the police investigation, he did not request the assistance of a public defence counsel. On 9 January 1992 the District Court, apparently of its own motion, appointed the lawyer H. as public defence counsel for the applicant.

On 22 April 1992 the applicant was charged with another incident of aggravated drunken driving and driving without a driver’s licence. According to the record of the police investigation, he stated that he wished the lawyer S. to be appointed as public defence counsel.

On 31 August 1992 the applicant was charged with yet another incident of aggravated drunken driving and driving without a driver’s licence. According to the record of the police investigation, he did not wish to be assisted by public defence counsel.

On 22 December 1992 the applicant was charged with causing a traffic accident, leaving the scene of the accident and driving without a driver’s licence. According to the record of the police investigation, he did not wish to be assisted by public defence counsel.

On 21 January 1993 the applicant was charged with possessing a knife in a public place. According to the record of the police investigation, he did not wish to be assisted by public defence counsel.

On 22 January 1993 the public prosecutor applied for a detention order regarding the applicant, who was suspected of attempted aggravated assault. According to the prosecutor’s application, the applicant wished to have S. as public defence counsel. At the subsequent hearing, the lawyer P.S. replaced, with the District Court’s permission, H. as public defence counsel. According to the minutes from the hearing, the applicant requested that S., a Swedish lawyer who had previously assisted him and who knew Finnish, should be appointed as his public defence counsel, whereupon the judge informed him that he should give reasons for his request in writing. The court rejected the application for a detention order and released the applicant. Subsequently he did not submit a written request for a replacement of defence counsel.

On 9 February 1993 the applicant was charged with attempted aggravated assault and possessing a knife in a public place.

When scheduling the main hearing, the District Court had telephone contact with the applicant who reiterated his request to have S. appointed as his public defence counsel. The court asked the applicant to contact H. in the matter.

Before the District Court the applicant apparently lodged some submissions independently of counsel H. It appears that these submissions were all in Finnish, the applicant invoking his right under the Nordic Language Convention (Nordiska språkkonventionen) to submit pleadings in his mother tongue. All the written submissions were translated into Swedish and entered into the case-file.

At the main hearing on 10 May 1994 the applicant was assisted by H. as public defence counsel. Neither the minutes of the hearing nor the judgment delivered in the case contains any indication that the applicant at that time expressed a wish to have his public defence counsel replaced. In addition to counsel’s oral submissions, the applicant defended himself orally in Finnish via a court-appointed interpreter. He denied some of the offences he was charged with, confessed some and declared that he neither confessed nor denied the remainder of the charges.

By a judgment of 24 May 1994 the applicant was convicted on all the above-mentioned counts and sentenced to 1 year and 2 months in prison. He was also ordered to pay 450 Swedish kronor (SEK) of the total litigation costs in the case. These included H.’s fees which amounted to SEK 10,395 for, inter alia, ten hours of work. The remainder of the costs was borne by the State.

The applicant appealed against the judgment in respect of the charges he had denied. The prosecution also appealed, seeking a more severe sentence. The prosecution stated that the applicant was in great need of public counsel for his defence, although he clearly did not wish to be represented by H.

On 23 August 1994, in the proceedings before the Court of Appeal (hovrätten) for Western Sweden, the applicant requested that counsel H. be replaced by S. The applicant reiterated that he had previously been assisted by S. and that he was able to communicate with him in Finnish. S. had declared that he was willing to assist the applicant as public defence counsel.

On 6 September 1994 the applicant’s request was refused, the appellate court considering that sufficient reasons for counsel to be replaced had not been presented. On 30 November 1994 the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen) refused the applicant leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal’s decision.

As in the proceedings before the District Court, the applicant apparently lodged some submissions in Finnish before the appellate court, all of which were translated into Swedish and entered into the case-file.

The Court of Appeal heard the case on 22 May 1995. H. attended the hearing as the applicant’s counsel. There is no indication in the minutes of the hearing that the applicant opposed H.’s presence. Having heard H.’s oral pleadings, the Court of Appeal gave the applicant the floor via a court-appointed interpreter.

On 6 June 1995 the Court of Appeal upheld the applicant’s conviction and sentence. It also decided that the litigation costs in the appeal proceedings – including H.’s fees of SEK 3,455 – should be paid by the State.

On 23 August 1995 the Supreme Court refused the applicant leave to appeal.","{'applicant': 'Antero Lagerblom', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2003}",001-60884

The case originated in an application (no. 26891/95) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Finnish national, Antero Lagerblom (“the applicant”), on 2 January 1995.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.

By a decision of 15 February 2000 the Court declared the application admissible.

The Government, but not the applicant, filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine), the applicant replied in writing to the Government’s observations.

On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, who was born in 1942, settled in Sweden in the second half of the 1980s. His mother tongue is Finnish.

On 3 December 1991 the applicant was charged before the District Court (tingsrätten) of Gothenburg with aggravated drunken driving and driving without a driver’s licence. According to the record of the police investigation, he did not request the assistance of a public defence counsel. On 9 January 1992 the District Court, apparently of its own motion, appointed the lawyer H. as public defence counsel for the applicant.

On 22 April 1992 the applicant was charged with another incident of aggravated drunken driving and driving without a driver’s licence. According to the record of the police investigation, he stated that he wished the lawyer S. to be appointed as public defence counsel.

On 31 August 1992 the applicant was charged with yet another incident of aggravated drunken driving and driving without a driver’s licence. According to the record of the police investigation, he did not wish to be assisted by public defence counsel.

On 22 December 1992 the applicant was charged with causing a traffic accident, leaving the scene of the accident and driving without a driver’s licence. According to the record of the police investigation, he did not wish to be assisted by public defence counsel.

On 21 January 1993 the applicant was charged with possessing a knife in a public place. According to the record of the police investigation, he did not wish to be assisted by public defence counsel.

On 22 January 1993 the public prosecutor applied for a detention order regarding the applicant, who was suspected of attempted aggravated assault. According to the prosecutor’s application, the applicant wished to have S. as public defence counsel. At the subsequent hearing, the lawyer P.S. replaced, with the District Court’s permission, H. as public defence counsel. According to the minutes from the hearing, the applicant requested that S., a Swedish lawyer who had previously assisted him and who knew Finnish, should be appointed as his public defence counsel, whereupon the judge informed him that he should give reasons for his request in writing. The court rejected the application for a detention order and released the applicant. Subsequently he did not submit a written request for a replacement of defence counsel.

On 9 February 1993 the applicant was charged with attempted aggravated assault and possessing a knife in a public place.

When scheduling the main hearing, the District Court had telephone contact with the applicant who reiterated his request to have S. appointed as his public defence counsel. The court asked the applicant to contact H. in the matter.

Before the District Court the applicant apparently lodged some submissions independently of counsel H. It appears that these submissions were all in Finnish, the applicant invoking his right under the Nordic Language Convention (Nordiska språkkonventionen) to submit pleadings in his mother tongue. All the written submissions were translated into Swedish and entered into the case-file.

At the main hearing on 10 May 1994 the applicant was assisted by H. as public defence counsel. Neither the minutes of the hearing nor the judgment delivered in the case contains any indication that the applicant at that time expressed a wish to have his public defence counsel replaced. In addition to counsel’s oral submissions, the applicant defended himself orally in Finnish via a court-appointed interpreter. He denied some of the offences he was charged with, confessed some and declared that he neither confessed nor denied the remainder of the charges.

By a judgment of 24 May 1994 the applicant was convicted on all the above-mentioned counts and sentenced to 1 year and 2 months in prison. He was also ordered to pay 450 Swedish kronor (SEK) of the total litigation costs in the case. These included H.’s fees which amounted to SEK 10,395 for, inter alia, ten hours of work. The remainder of the costs was borne by the State.

The applicant appealed against the judgment in respect of the charges he had denied. The prosecution also appealed, seeking a more severe sentence. The prosecution stated that the applicant was in great need of public counsel for his defence, although he clearly did not wish to be represented by H.

On 23 August 1994, in the proceedings before the Court of Appeal (hovrätten) for Western Sweden, the applicant requested that counsel H. be replaced by S. The applicant reiterated that he had previously been assisted by S. and that he was able to communicate with him in Finnish. S. had declared that he was willing to assist the applicant as public defence counsel.

On 6 September 1994 the applicant’s request was refused, the appellate court considering that sufficient reasons for counsel to be replaced had not been presented. On 30 November 1994 the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen) refused the applicant leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal’s decision.

As in the proceedings before the District Court, the applicant apparently lodged some submissions in Finnish before the appellate court, all of which were translated into Swedish and entered into the case-file.

The Court of Appeal heard the case on 22 May 1995. H. attended the hearing as the applicant’s counsel. There is no indication in the minutes of the hearing that the applicant opposed H.’s presence. Having heard H.’s oral pleadings, the Court of Appeal gave the applicant the floor via a court-appointed interpreter.

On 6 June 1995 the Court of Appeal upheld the applicant’s conviction and sentence. It also decided that the litigation costs in the appeal proceedings – including H.’s fees of SEK 3,455 – should be paid by the State.

On 23 August 1995 the Supreme Court refused the applicant leave to appeal.","{'applicant': 'Antero Lagerblom', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2003}",001-60884

The case originated in an application (no. 26891/95) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Finnish national, Antero Lagerblom (“the applicant”), on 2 January 1995.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1961.

In March 1994 the applicant was suspected by police officers in the Cambridge Constabulary of involvement in robbery. The view was taken by the Cambridgeshire Regional Crime Squad that it was necessary to place a hidden battery-powered listening and recording device in the applicant’s home. An application was therefore made to the Chief Constable for the instalment of such a device, which was authorised on 21 June 1994, pursuant to the non-statutory Home Office Guidelines of 1984.

In order to install the device, the police decided to arrest the applicant and his partner in connection with another matter (credit card fraud) and to remove them and their children from their home. Enquiries into the credit card fraud had previously lapsed without any arrest or questioning of the applicant or his partner. However, DC Harrison of the Regional Crime Squad and WDC Fletcher, an officer in the intelligence bureau of the Cambridgeshire County Constabulary, decided to revive the investigation for the purpose of removing the applicant and his partner from their home for long enough to enable the installation of the listening device.

WDC Fletcher briefed three officers about purported grounds for arresting the applicant and his partner for credit card fraud, without informing them of the intended installation of the device.

At 6.15 a.m. on 8 July 1994 the three officers arrested the applicant’s partner in her home and shortly thereafter arrested the applicant. Both were taken to the police station. The officers seized the keys to the applicant’s home and car. Officers from the Regional Crime Squad then used the house key to enter the applicant’s home and install the listening device. They also had a copy of the key cut to enable them to enter the house at a later date.

The applicant and his partner were released from police custody on the evening of 8 July 1994 after being interviewed. Neither was charged, but both were released on police bail and required to report back to the police station on 24 August 1994. The applicant’s keys to his home and car were returned to him.

On 24 August 1994 the applicant and his partner attended the police station in accordance with their bail and were interviewed again. Neither was charged at that time or subsequently with credit card fraud. During their interview police officers entered their home using the duplicate key in order to renew the battery in the listening device.

During September 1994, police officers again entered the applicant’s home to renew the battery in the listening device.

As a result of conversations that were recorded between the applicant and J, his co-defendant in the criminal proceedings, both men were arrested in September 1994. They were charged with conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary between 1 January 1993 and 9 December 1994.

The trial was at Peterborough Crown Court in October 1996. An application was made, in a voir dire procedure, on behalf of the defendants for the tape recorded evidence to be excluded under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 on the basis that it had been obtained unlawfully and in breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This application was rejected by the trial judge on 24 October 1996. The judge found that the officers who carried out the arrests on 8 July 1994 did have reasonable grounds for suspecting those whom they arrested and that if further information had arisen at the interviews or from the other enquiries which were carried out it was possible that charges would have been brought for those matters. He did find that the removal of the applicant’s keys was in breach of the search and seizure requirements of PACE, that the taking and use of the house key constituted a civil wrong, that there was a trespass to the applicant’s home and that minor criminal damage had taken place. However, balancing the various factors, including the fact that the tape-recordings amounted to confessions of serious crimes involving the possible use of firearms, that there was no suggestion of improper inducement or incitement to commit the offences and that there was no dispute about the content of the conversations, the judge ruled the evidence admissible.

As a result of the ruling on admissibility, the applicant and his co-defendant changed their pleas to guilty. They were each sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment.

On 18 December 1997, after being granted leave to appeal, the applicant’s appeal against conviction was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (R. v. Chalkley and Jeffries [1998] 2 All ER 155). On 15 June 1998 the House of Lords refused the applicant’s petition for leave to appeal. In early 2001, the applicant was released on licence.","{'applicant': 'Tony Michael Chalkley', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 56, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2003}",001-61135

The case originated in an application (no. 63831/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Tony Michael Chalkley (“the applicant”), on 20 March 1995.

The applicant was represented by Mr J. Welch of Liberty, London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The applicant complained about the use of a surveillance device in his home, invoking Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention.

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

By a decision of 26 September 2002, the Court declared the application partly admissible, partly inadmissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on just satisfactions (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1961.

In March 1994 the applicant was suspected by police officers in the Cambridge Constabulary of involvement in robbery. The view was taken by the Cambridgeshire Regional Crime Squad that it was necessary to place a hidden battery-powered listening and recording device in the applicant’s home. An application was therefore made to the Chief Constable for the instalment of such a device, which was authorised on 21 June 1994, pursuant to the non-statutory Home Office Guidelines of 1984.

In order to install the device, the police decided to arrest the applicant and his partner in connection with another matter (credit card fraud) and to remove them and their children from their home. Enquiries into the credit card fraud had previously lapsed without any arrest or questioning of the applicant or his partner. However, DC Harrison of the Regional Crime Squad and WDC Fletcher, an officer in the intelligence bureau of the Cambridgeshire County Constabulary, decided to revive the investigation for the purpose of removing the applicant and his partner from their home for long enough to enable the installation of the listening device.

WDC Fletcher briefed three officers about purported grounds for arresting the applicant and his partner for credit card fraud, without informing them of the intended installation of the device.

At 6.15 a.m. on 8 July 1994 the three officers arrested the applicant’s partner in her home and shortly thereafter arrested the applicant. Both were taken to the police station. The officers seized the keys to the applicant’s home and car. Officers from the Regional Crime Squad then used the house key to enter the applicant’s home and install the listening device. They also had a copy of the key cut to enable them to enter the house at a later date.

The applicant and his partner were released from police custody on the evening of 8 July 1994 after being interviewed. Neither was charged, but both were released on police bail and required to report back to the police station on 24 August 1994. The applicant’s keys to his home and car were returned to him.

On 24 August 1994 the applicant and his partner attended the police station in accordance with their bail and were interviewed again. Neither was charged at that time or subsequently with credit card fraud. During their interview police officers entered their home using the duplicate key in order to renew the battery in the listening device.

During September 1994, police officers again entered the applicant’s home to renew the battery in the listening device.

As a result of conversations that were recorded between the applicant and J, his co-defendant in the criminal proceedings, both men were arrested in September 1994. They were charged with conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary between 1 January 1993 and 9 December 1994.

The trial was at Peterborough Crown Court in October 1996. An application was made, in a voir dire procedure, on behalf of the defendants for the tape recorded evidence to be excluded under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 on the basis that it had been obtained unlawfully and in breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This application was rejected by the trial judge on 24 October 1996. The judge found that the officers who carried out the arrests on 8 July 1994 did have reasonable grounds for suspecting those whom they arrested and that if further information had arisen at the interviews or from the other enquiries which were carried out it was possible that charges would have been brought for those matters. He did find that the removal of the applicant’s keys was in breach of the search and seizure requirements of PACE, that the taking and use of the house key constituted a civil wrong, that there was a trespass to the applicant’s home and that minor criminal damage had taken place. However, balancing the various factors, including the fact that the tape-recordings amounted to confessions of serious crimes involving the possible use of firearms, that there was no suggestion of improper inducement or incitement to commit the offences and that there was no dispute about the content of the conversations, the judge ruled the evidence admissible.

As a result of the ruling on admissibility, the applicant and his co-defendant changed their pleas to guilty. They were each sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment.

On 18 December 1997, after being granted leave to appeal, the applicant’s appeal against conviction was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (R. v. Chalkley and Jeffries [1998] 2 All ER 155). On 15 June 1998 the House of Lords refused the applicant’s petition for leave to appeal.

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 18 July 1986, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bodén. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

The Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mr. G. Lagergren, the elected judge of Swedish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 3 (b)). On 26 September 1986, the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely Mr. F. Gölcüklü, Mr. L.-E. Pettiti, Mr. R. Bernhardt, Mr. A.M. Donner and Mr. J. De Meyer (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 4) (art. 43). Mr. R. Macdonald, substitute judge, subsequently replaced Mr. Donner, who was prevented from taking part in the consideration of the case (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1).

The Swedish Government (“the Government“) informed the Registrar on 29 October 1986 that negotiations were being conducted with the applicant with a view to arriving at a friendly settlement and then, on 4 February 1987, that the negotiations had proved unsuccessful.

Mr. Ryssdal, who had assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 5), ascertained, through the Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Government and the Delegate of the Commission regarding the need for a written procedure. Having regard to their concurring statements, he decided on 26 February 1987 that it was not necessary for memorials to be filed (Rule 37 § 1) and directed that the oral proceedings should open on 23 March 1987 (Rule 38). Prior to that, on 12 and 18 February, the applicant had lodged claims for just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) (Rule 49 taken together with Rule 1 (k)). He provided further particulars of these claims on 24 April at the request of the President.

The hearing was held in public at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. Immediately before it opened, the Court had held a preparatory meeting. There appeared before the Court:

for the Commission Mr. Gaukur Jörundsson, Delegate. The Court heard addresses by Mr. Corell for the Government and by Mr. Gaukur Jörundsson for the Commission, as well as their replies to the questions put by the Court and several judges.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, Mr. Gunnar Bodén, was born in 1939. He is a Swedish citizen resident in Falun and a car driver by profession. He owned, together with his brother Mr. B. Bodén, the properties Källviken 1:18, 1:25 and 1:26.

On 30 June 1977, the Falun Municipal Council (kommunfullmäktige) adopted an area plan (områdesplan) with a view to the development of a housing estate in an area including the applicant’s properties. On 9 February 1978, the Municipal Council decided to apply to the Government for an expropriation permit for this area.

The applicant objected to the expropriation in respect of two of the three properties concerned, because, as he submitted to the Government, he doubted that they were needed for the development contemplated and, further, he wanted to live with his mother in his parents’ home situated on one of the properties. He claimed that, when working out and adopting the area plan, the Municipal Council had not taken his interests sufficiently into account, something that would have been possible within the framework of a somewhat modified plan. However, the Government, taking the view that the Municipal Council had shown the need to include the applicant’s properties, concluded that the conditions laid down in the Expropriation Act 1972 (expropriationslagen 1972:719 - “the 1972 Act“) were satisfied. On 1 March 1979, they issued an expropriation permit.

The decision indicated that the issue of the permit had to be followed by the institution of proceedings by the Municipality before a real estate court not later than 3 March 1980. An action, the object of which was to settle the terms of the expropriation (see paragraph 15 below), was commenced on 28 February 1980 before the Real Estate Court at the Falun District Court (tingsrätten).

The applicant, his brother and the Municipality were involved in negotiations for a settlement until 2 July 1984. On that date, before the main hearings started, they finally concluded an agreement: the applicant and his brother were to sell the properties to the Municipality, which was to lease back to the applicant for a period of five years, with a possibility of prolongation, a house situated thereon. On 17 August, the Real Estate Court struck the case off its list since, as a result of the settlement, the Municipality had withdrawn its claim for expropriation.

On 17 December 1986, after the present case had been brought before the European Court of Human Rights, the Municipality of Falun concluded an agreement with the applicant for the repurchase by him of the properties for 235,000 Swedish crowns, the same amount as it had paid for them in 1984.","{'applicant': 'Gunnar Bodén', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1987}",001-57441

The case originated in an application (no. 10930/84) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 10 January 1984 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Gunnar Bodén. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court.

The Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mr. G. Lagergren, the elected judge of Swedish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 3 (b)). On 26 September 1986, the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely Mr. F. Gölcüklü, Mr. L.-E. Pettiti, Mr. R. Bernhardt, Mr. A.M. Donner and Mr. J. De Meyer (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 4) (art. 43). Mr. R. Macdonald, substitute judge, subsequently replaced Mr. Donner, who was prevented from taking part in the consideration of the case (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1).

The Swedish Government (“the Government“) informed the Registrar on 29 October 1986 that negotiations were being conducted with the applicant with a view to arriving at a friendly settlement and then, on 4 February 1987, that the negotiations had proved unsuccessful.

Mr. Ryssdal, who had assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 5), ascertained, through the Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Government and the Delegate of the Commission regarding the need for a written procedure. Having regard to their concurring statements, he decided on 26 February 1987 that it was not necessary for memorials to be filed (Rule 37 § 1) and directed that the oral proceedings should open on 23 March 1987 (Rule 38). Prior to that, on 12 and 18 February, the applicant had lodged claims for just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) (Rule 49 taken together with Rule 1 (k)). He provided further particulars of these claims on 24 April at the request of the President.

The hearing was held in public at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. Immediately before it opened, the Court had held a preparatory meeting. There appeared before the Court:

for the Government Mr. H. Corell, Ambassador, Under-Secretary for Legal and Consular Affairs, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Agent, Mr. P. Löfmarck, Under-Secretary for Legal Affairs, Ministry of Transport and Communications, Mr. H. Berglin, Legal Adviser, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Advisers;

for the Commission Mr. Gaukur Jörundsson, Delegate. The Court heard addresses by Mr. Corell for the Government and by Mr. Gaukur Jörundsson for the Commission, as well as their replies to the questions put by the Court and several judges.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, Mr. Gunnar Bodén, was born in 1939. He is a Swedish citizen resident in Falun and a car driver by profession. He owned, together with his brother Mr. B. Bodén, the properties Källviken 1:18, 1:25 and 1:26.

On 30 June 1977, the Falun Municipal Council (kommunfullmäktige) adopted an area plan (områdesplan) with a view to the development of a housing estate in an area including the applicant’s properties. On 9 February 1978, the Municipal Council decided to apply to the Government for an expropriation permit for this area.

The applicant objected to the expropriation in respect of two of the three properties concerned, because, as he submitted to the Government, he doubted that they were needed for the development contemplated and, further, he wanted to live with his mother in his parents’ home situated on one of the properties. He claimed that, when working out and adopting the area plan, the Municipal Council had not taken his interests sufficiently into account, something that would have been possible within the framework of a somewhat modified plan. However, the Government, taking the view that the Municipal Council had shown the need to include the applicant’s properties, concluded that the conditions laid down in the Expropriation Act 1972 (expropriationslagen 1972:719 - “the 1972 Act“) were satisfied. On 1 March 1979, they issued an expropriation permit.

The decision indicated that the issue of the permit had to be followed by the institution of proceedings by the Municipality before a real estate court not later than 3 March 1980. An action, the object of which was to settle the terms of the expropriation (see paragraph 15 below), was commenced on 28 February 1980 before the Real Estate Court at the Falun District Court (tingsrätten).

The applicant, his brother and the Municipality were involved in negotiations for a settlement until 2 July 1984. On that date, before the main hearings started, they finally concluded an agreement: the applicant and his brother were to sell the properties to the Municipality, which was to lease back to the applicant for a period of five years, with a possibility of prolongation, a house situated thereon. On 17 August, the Real Estate Court struck the case off its list since, as a result of the settlement, the Municipality had withdrawn its claim for expropriation.

On 17 December 1986, after the present case had been brought before the European Court of Human Rights, the Municipality of Falun concluded an agreement with the applicant for the repurchase by him of the properties for 235,000 Swedish crowns, the same amount as it had paid for them in 1984.","{'applicant': 'Gunnar Bodén', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1987}",001-57441

The case originated in an application (no. 48015/99) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Ronald Easterbrook (“the applicant”), on 13 April 1999.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr S. Creighton, a lawyer practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant alleged, in particular, that his tariff as a discretionary life prisoner had not been set at trial by a judge but had been fixed by the Secretary of State after a long delay and without an oral hearing. He invoked Articles 6 § 1 and 5 § 4 of the Convention.

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

By a decision of 26 September 2002, the Court declared the application admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed brief observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1931 and is currently serving a prison sentence in HM Prison Highdown, Surrey.

On 30 November 1988, the applicant was convicted at the Central Criminal Court in London of robbery, wounding with intent, possessing firearms with intent to endanger life and possessing ammunition with intent to endanger life.

The offences arose out of a single robbery which occurred on 23 November 1987 at a shop in Woolwich. One of the applicant’s associates entered the shop, snatched a Securicor bag containing 10,400 pounds sterling and held a loaded revolver to the head of a member of the shop’s staff. The applicant, armed with a loaded revolver, kept watch outside. During a changeover of cars in their flight from the crime, the applicant and his associates were intercepted by the police, who surrounded them and told them to lay down their arms. The applicant fired six shots, wounding one police officer in the leg. The police returned fire and one of the applicant’s associates was killed. The applicant received a superficial wound to his shoulder. He was arrested and immediately detained.

The applicant was subsequently tried and was not represented at his trial. He stated that he was informed by his counsel that his defence was “political” in nature and could not be put by a professional advocate. His counsel then withdrew. The applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment. In sentencing him, the judge made reference to his long, violent criminal record and the dangerous nature of his character.

In June 1990, the Court of Appeal refused the applicant’s renewed application for leave to appeal against conviction, leave having already been refused by a single judge. The Court of Appeal also rejected the applicant’s appeal against sentence. At this hearing the applicant was again not represented.

On 9 December 1992, a certificate was issued on behalf of the Secretary of State, stating that the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 for certifying the tariffs of discretionary life sentence prisoners would not apply to the applicant. The applicant’s release from prison would therefore be at the Home Secretary’s discretion, following a favourable recommendation from the Parole Board and after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice and trial judge, if available. The certificate stated that it was Home Office policy that no life sentence prisoner should be detained more that 17 years without a review by the Parole Board. The first review of the applicant’s case by the Parole Board would be in November 2004. The applicant stated that he had no record of receiving this document.

On 27 July 1995, the Prison Service informed the applicant that, following a judgment of the House of Lords, the Secretary of State would now be setting a specific tariff which would be disclosed to the applicant, along with the judicial recommendations and any reasons for any departure from them. The judicial recommendations - that in the applicant’s case “ ’life’ should mean ‘life’ ” – were disclosed to the applicant and he was invited to make representations.

On 5 February 1998, the Home Secretary agreed to certify that the applicant should be subject to the arrangements for the release of discretionary life prisoners, despite having previously qualified the applicant as someone serving a mandatory life sentence. The decision of 5 February 1998 also set the tariff of the applicant’s sentence at 16 years, expiring on 24 November 2003.

The applicant’s solicitors made written submissions as to the appropriate length of the tariff and submitted that the applicant should be entitled to an oral hearing before the Lord Chief Justice. The applicant’s solicitors were informed by a letter of 13 August 1998 that the Lord Chief Justice had revised his opinion and that he recommended a tariff of 12-13 years, but that no oral hearing would be allowed. On 27 November 1998, the Prison Service informed the applicant’s solicitor that the Home Secretary had decided on a tariff of 12.5 years, to expire in May 2000.

On 8 January 1999, the applicant made an application for judicial review of the Home Secretary’s decision of 27 November 1998. The application was dismissed on 11 February 1999. A renewed application was dismissed on 22 March 1999.

After the tariff expired in May 2000, the applicant became eligible for Parole Board review procedures.

The case originated in an application (no. 48015/99) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Ronald Easterbrook (“the applicant”), on 13 April 1999.

The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr S. Creighton, a lawyer practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

The applicant alleged, in particular, that his tariff as a discretionary life prisoner had not been set at trial by a judge but had been fixed by the Secretary of State after a long delay and without an oral hearing. He invoked Articles 6 § 1 and 5 § 4 of the Convention.

The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.

By a decision of 26 September 2002, the Court declared the application admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed brief observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1931 and is currently serving a prison sentence in HM Prison Highdown, Surrey.

On 30 November 1988, the applicant was convicted at the Central Criminal Court in London of robbery, wounding with intent, possessing firearms with intent to endanger life and possessing ammunition with intent to endanger life.

The offences arose out of a single robbery which occurred on 23 November 1987 at a shop in Woolwich. One of the applicant’s associates entered the shop, snatched a Securicor bag containing 10,400 pounds sterling and held a loaded revolver to the head of a member of the shop’s staff. The applicant, armed with a loaded revolver, kept watch outside. During a changeover of cars in their flight from the crime, the applicant and his associates were intercepted by the police, who surrounded them and told them to lay down their arms. The applicant fired six shots, wounding one police officer in the leg. The police returned fire and one of the applicant’s associates was killed. The applicant received a superficial wound to his shoulder. He was arrested and immediately detained.

The applicant was subsequently tried and was not represented at his trial. He stated that he was informed by his counsel that his defence was “political” in nature and could not be put by a professional advocate. His counsel then withdrew. The applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment. In sentencing him, the judge made reference to his long, violent criminal record and the dangerous nature of his character.

In June 1990, the Court of Appeal refused the applicant’s renewed application for leave to appeal against conviction, leave having already been refused by a single judge. The Court of Appeal also rejected the applicant’s appeal against sentence. At this hearing the applicant was again not represented.

On 9 December 1992, a certificate was issued on behalf of the Secretary of State, stating that the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 for certifying the tariffs of discretionary life sentence prisoners would not apply to the applicant. The applicant’s release from prison would therefore be at the Home Secretary’s discretion, following a favourable recommendation from the Parole Board and after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice and trial judge, if available. The certificate stated that it was Home Office policy that no life sentence prisoner should be detained more that 17 years without a review by the Parole Board. The first review of the applicant’s case by the Parole Board would be in November 2004. The applicant stated that he had no record of receiving this document.

On 27 July 1995, the Prison Service informed the applicant that, following a judgment of the House of Lords, the Secretary of State would now be setting a specific tariff which would be disclosed to the applicant, along with the judicial recommendations and any reasons for any departure from them. The judicial recommendations - that in the applicant’s case “ ’life’ should mean ‘life’ ” – were disclosed to the applicant and he was invited to make representations.

On 5 February 1998, the Home Secretary agreed to certify that the applicant should be subject to the arrangements for the release of discretionary life prisoners, despite having previously qualified the applicant as someone serving a mandatory life sentence. The decision of 5 February 1998 also set the tariff of the applicant’s sentence at 16 years, expiring on 24 November 2003.

The applicant’s solicitors made written submissions as to the appropriate length of the tariff and submitted that the applicant should be entitled to an oral hearing before the Lord Chief Justice. The applicant’s solicitors were informed by a letter of 13 August 1998 that the Lord Chief Justice had revised his opinion and that he recommended a tariff of 12-13 years, but that no oral hearing would be allowed. On 27 November 1998, the Prison Service informed the applicant’s solicitor that the Home Secretary had decided on a tariff of 12.5 years, to expire in May 2000.

On 8 January 1999, the applicant made an application for judicial review of the Home Secretary’s decision of 27 November 1998. The application was dismissed on 11 February 1999. A renewed application was dismissed on 22 March 1999.

After the tariff expired in May 2000, the applicant became eligible for Parole Board review procedures. He has stated however that he has decided not to participate in the procedures due to his continuing belief that the Government have breached his human rights and still refuses to acknowledge those breaches.","{'applicant': 'Ronald Easterbrook', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2003}",001-61134

The case originated in an application against Denmark lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Danish national, Mr Kurt Nielsen, (“the applicant”), on 23 September 1996. The application was registered on 18 October 1996 under file no. 33488/96. The applicant complained that, contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, civil proceedings instituted by him had not been heard within a reasonable time.

On 9 September 1998 the Commission (Second Chamber) decided to give notice of the application to the respondent Government and invited them to submit their observations on its admissibility and merits. The Government submitted their observations on 17 November 1998, to which the applicant replied on 28 December 1998.

Following the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 § 2 thereof, the application falls to be examined by the Court.

In accordance with Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the case to the Second Section. The Chamber constituted within the Section included ex officio Mr P. Lorenzen, the judge elected in respect of Denmark (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 26 § 1 (a) of the Rules of Court), and Mr C.L. Rozakis, the President of the Section (Rule 26 § 1 (a)). The other members designated by the latter to complete the Chamber were Mr M. Fischbach, Mr G. Bonello, Mrs V. Stráznická, Mr A.B. Baka, and Mr E. Levits (Rule 26 § 1 (b)). Mrs V. Stráznická was subsequently unable to participate in the examination of the case and she was replaced by Mrs M. Tsatsa‑Nikolovska.

On 22 June 1999, the Court declared the application admissible.

AS TO THE FACTS

The applicant is a Danish citizen, born in 1966. He resides in Skanderborg, Denmark.

On 12 November 1986 the applicant was involved in a car accident. He was severely injured and is now partly disabled.

On 26 February 1988 the applicant instituted proceedings against three insurance companies in the City Court of Skanderborg (retten i Skanderborg). He claimed that the defendant companies should be held liable to pay, jointly and severally, a specified amount in compensation for permanent disablement and loss of working capacity.

On 11 May 1988 the case was adjourned pending the outcome of the applicant’s request to the National Board of Industrial Injuries (Arbejdsskadestyrelsen, hereinafter called the NBI), to give an opinion on the degree of disablement and working capacity. The applicant was hereafter examined by two medical experts at the request of the NBI which also, on 2 February 1989, requested the Municipality of Skanderborg to provide certain information. This information was provided by the Municipality on 21 December 1989, following which the NBI submitted its expert opinion on 17 January 1990. On 7 March 1990 the NBI was asked certain additional questions as to the degree of disablement and working capacity. By letter of 8 February 1991, the Board maintained its opinion.

On 22 February 1991 the applicant requested the NBI to submit an opinion as to the moment in time his injuries could be considered stationary. The NBI submitted its opinion on 13 May 1991.

From May 1991 until March 1992 the parties exchanged views and submitted pleadings during a number of preliminary court sessions. During this period the applicant was asked several times by the defendants to provide additional and more specific particulars. On 11 March 1992 one of the defendant companies produced a supplementary list of questions for the NBI to which the applicant objected, in particular since they ought to have been submitted much earlier. On 8 April 1992 the City Court adjourned the case in order to obtain further information from the NBI. It nevertheless scheduled the trial to commence on 24 August 1992. The NBI was informed on 13 April 1992 of the request to submit a further opinion. On 13 August 1992 the City Court decided to adjourn the case until further notice since the information from the NBI was not available. The court took note of the fact that the applicant’s counsel opposed a division of the case in order to decide the liability question separately. The applicant appealed against the decision to adjourn the case to the High Court of Western Denmark (Vestre Landsret) which, however, upheld the decision on 1 October 1992.

On 8 January 1993 the NBI - which had only on 4 November 1992 received payment of an obligatory charge from the defendants’ counsel - announced that it could not submit a reply on the basis of the previous medical examinations as they were considered to be too old. The applicant was accordingly examined again by medical experts following which the NBI submitted its opinion as to the applicant’s degree of disablement and working capacity on 30 June 1994.

On 25 January 1995 the case was heard by the City Court. By judgment of 15 February 1995 the defendant companies were held liable to pay 950,803.60 DKK plus interest to the applicant. On 28 February 1995 the defendants appealed against the judgment to the High Court of Western Denmark. On 28 September 1995 the High Court fixed the trial to commence on 1 August 1996. It was later rescheduled to commence on 5 September 1996.

By judgment of 9 September 1996 the High Court upheld the judgment of the City Court. The judgment has become final.","{'applicant': 'Kurt Nielsen', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'DNK', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2000}",001-58590

On 12 November 1986 the applicant was involved in a car accident. He was severely injured and is now partly disabled.

On 26 February 1988 the applicant instituted proceedings against three insurance companies in the City Court of Skanderborg (retten i Skanderborg). He claimed that the defendant companies should be held liable to pay, jointly and severally, a specified amount in compensation for permanent disablement and loss of working capacity.

On 11 May 1988 the case was adjourned pending the outcome of the applicant’s request to the National Board of Industrial Injuries (Arbejdsskadestyrelsen, hereinafter called the NBI), to give an opinion on the degree of disablement and working capacity. The applicant was hereafter examined by two medical experts at the request of the NBI which also, on 2 February 1989, requested the Municipality of Skanderborg to provide certain information. This information was provided by the Municipality on 21 December 1989, following which the NBI submitted its expert opinion on 17 January 1990. On 7 March 1990 the NBI was asked certain additional questions as to the degree of disablement and working capacity. By letter of 8 February 1991, the Board maintained its opinion.

On 22 February 1991 the applicant requested the NBI to submit an opinion as to the moment in time his injuries could be considered stationary. The NBI submitted its opinion on 13 May 1991.

From May 1991 until March 1992 the parties exchanged views and submitted pleadings during a number of preliminary court sessions. During this period the applicant was asked several times by the defendants to provide additional and more specific particulars. On 11 March 1992 one of the defendant companies produced a supplementary list of questions for the NBI to which the applicant objected, in particular since they ought to have been submitted much earlier. On 8 April 1992 the City Court adjourned the case in order to obtain further information from the NBI. It nevertheless scheduled the trial to commence on 24 August 1992. The NBI was informed on 13 April 1992 of the request to submit a further opinion. On 13 August 1992 the City Court decided to adjourn the case until further notice since the information from the NBI was not available. The court took note of the fact that the applicant’s counsel opposed a division of the case in order to decide the liability question separately. The applicant appealed against the decision to adjourn the case to the High Court of Western Denmark (Vestre Landsret) which, however, upheld the decision on 1 October 1992.

On 8 January 1993 the NBI - which had only on 4 November 1992 received payment of an obligatory charge from the defendants’ counsel - announced that it could not submit a reply on the basis of the previous medical examinations as they were considered to be too old. The applicant was accordingly examined again by medical experts following which the NBI submitted its opinion as to the applicant’s degree of disablement and working capacity on 30 June 1994.

On 25 January 1995 the case was heard by the City Court. By judgment of 15 February 1995 the defendant companies were held liable to pay 950,803.60 DKK plus interest to the applicant. On 28 February 1995 the defendants appealed against the judgment to the High Court of Western Denmark. On 28 September 1995 the High Court fixed the trial to commence on 1 August 1996. It was later rescheduled to commence on 5 September 1996.

By judgment of 9 September 1996 the High Court upheld the judgment of the City Court. The judgment has become final.","{'applicant': 'Kurt Nielsen', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'DNK', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2000}",001-58590

The case originated in an application against Denmark lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Danish national, Mr Kurt Nielsen, (“the applicant”), on 23 September 1996. The application was registered on 18 October 1996 under file no. 33488/96. The applicant complained that, contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, civil proceedings instituted by him had not been heard within a reasonable time.

On 9 September 1998 the Commission (Second Chamber) decided to give notice of the application to the respondent Government and invited them to submit their observations on its admissibility and merits. The Government submitted their observations on 17 November 1998, to which the applicant replied on 28 December 1998.

Following the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 § 2 thereof, the application falls to be examined by the Court.

In accordance with Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the case to the Second Section. The Chamber constituted within the Section included ex officio Mr P. Lorenzen, the judge elected in respect of Denmark (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 26 § 1 (a) of the Rules of Court), and Mr C.L. Rozakis, the President of the Section (Rule 26 § 1 (a)). The other members designated by the latter to complete the Chamber were Mr M. Fischbach, Mr G. Bonello, Mrs V. Stráznická, Mr A.B. Baka, and Mr E. Levits (Rule 26 § 1 (b)). Mrs V. Stráznická was subsequently unable to participate in the examination of the case and she was replaced by Mrs M. Tsatsa‑Nikolovska.

505,"PROCEDURE

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) on 4 December 1998, within the three-month period laid down by former Articles 32 § 1 and 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 33745/96) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under former Article 25 by Mr Norman Scarth (“the applicant”), a British national, on 2 February 1996. The Commission’s request referred to former Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (former Article 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

Following the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with Article 5 § 4 thereof read in conjunction with Rule 100 § 1 and Rule 24 § 6 of the Rules of Court, a Panel of the Grand Chamber decided on 14 January 1999 that the case should be dealt with by a Chamber constituted within one of the Sections of the Court.

In accordance with Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the case to the Fourth Section. The Chamber ultimately constituted within the Section included Mr A. Pastor Rudruejo, Mr L. Caflisch, Mr J. Makarczyk, Mr I. Cabral Barreto, Mr V. Butkevych, Mr J. Hedigan and Mrs S. Botoucharova.

The applicant requested permission to present his own case (Rule 36 § 4 (b)). On 1 March 1999 the President of the Chamber declined to grant leave.

On the same date, the President of the Chamber invited the parties to submit a memorial on the issues in the case. The applicant submitted a memorial on 29 April 1999; on 11 May 1999 the Government conceded that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in the circumstances of the case.

On 1 June 1999 the Chamber decided not to hold a hearing in the case.

On 30 June 1999 the Government stated that they were prepared to waive the right to the presence of an ad hoc judge.

The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr H. Llewellyn, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. the circumstances of the case

The facts of the case, as found by the Commission and not contested before the Court, are as follows:

On 26 September 1994, proceedings for recovery of a debt of 697 pounds sterling (GBP) were commenced by Bradley Grange Stud Limited against the applicant in the Scarborough County Court.

By reason of Order 19, rule 3 (1), of the County Court Rules 1981 the case was referred for hearing by way of arbitration under Order 19, rule 7, of the County Court Rules.

On 8 November 1994 a preliminary hearing took place. The plaintiff did not attend, and Mr Scarth requested that the claim be struck out. The District Judge (the arbitrator) refused to do so.

Mr Scarth made an application for the main hearing to be in public and for evidence to be given on oath. This application was heard on 3 January 1995 and refused. The reasons for the refusal were not recorded formally, but in a note of 21 July 1997 prepared in the context of the Convention proceedings, District Judge Elliott made the following comments: “At this stage I can only say that it is likely that I took the view that the [applicant's] reasons as set out in his application were not in my view good reasons for the private nature of arbitration proceedings to be dispensed with. Further the sum of the dispute and the nature of the dispute were basically no different from the usual “run of the mill“ arbitration disputes heard in any county court. Lastly, at the time the arbitration hearing had been fixed, prior to the filing of the application [for the case to be heard in open court]. I cannot say with certainty the above are the reasons I gave. The earlier fixing of an arbitration hearing date would have carried little weight with me if I had considered the application had any particular merit. ...“

The arbitration hearing took place in private on 16 January 1995. On 31 January 1995 District Judge Elliott made his award in writing, finding in favour of the plaintiff.

Mr Scarth made an application for the arbitration award to be set aside on the ground that there had been “misconduct“ or “errors of law“ by the District Judge, pursuant to Order 19, rule 8 (1), of the County Court Rules 1981.

The hearing of the application to set aside took place before a Recorder in private. He refused the application on 9 May 1995 and made a costs order against Mr Scarth. These costs were subsequently assessed at GBP 1,032.76.

Mr Scarth then applied for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal alleging a lack of public hearing, misconduct by the judge and an overall unfairness of the proceedings. Mr Scarth was heard in open court and leave was refused on 9 November 1995. Lord Justice Morritt noted that the “European Convention on Human Rights is not part of our law in the way the European Community law is, and the provisions of the county court rule to which I have referred entitled the District Judge to hold the hearing in private“. He further found that the judge could not be said to have been guilty of any misconduct and rejected Mr Scarth’s allegations as to unfairness. In connection with a submission that the District Judge was wrong on one particular point of law, he continued: “That seems to me to be a matter largely of fact, because if these two cheques were handed over for value and either of them was countermanded and subsequently presented, then it would seem that there would be a cause of action on the cheque ...“.

II. relevant domestic law

Order 19, rule 3 (1), of the County Court Rules (“the Rules“), as in force at the relevant time, states that any proceedings in which the sum claimed or amount involved does not exceed GBP 1,000 shall be referred for arbitration.

Order 19, rule 7 (1), (3) and (4), of the Rules provides as follows: “(1) Any proceedings referred to arbitration shall be dealt with in accordance with the following paragraphs of this rule unless the arbitrator otherwise orders. (3) The hearing shall be informal and the strict rules of evidence shall not apply; unless the arbitrator orders otherwise, the hearing shall be held in private and evidence shall not be taken on oath. (4) At the hearing the arbitrator may adopt any method of procedure which he may consider to be fair and which gives to each party an equal opportunity to have his case presented;...“

Order 19, rule 8 (1), of the Rules reads as follows: “Where proceedings are referred to arbitration, the award of the arbitrator shall be final and may only be set aside ... on the ground that there has been misconduct by the arbitrator or that the arbitrator made an error of law.“

In monetary matters of less than GBP 5,000, and wherever the County Court judge makes his order in an appellate capacity, leave to appeal must be obtained before a County Court order may be appealed to the Court of Appeal (see RSC 1997, Order 59, rule 1/34, referring to the County Court Appeals Order 1991).

Under the Civil Procedure Rules, which came into force on 26 April 1999, hearings, including those in small claims cases, are to be held in public. There is a discretion for the court to hold a hearing in private where: (a) publicity would defeat the object of the hearing; (b) it involves matters relating to national security; (c) it involves confidential information (including information relating to personal financial matters) and publicity would damage that confidentiality; (d) a private hearing is necessary to protect the interests of any child or person suffering from mental incapacity; (e) it is a hearing of an application made without notice and it would be unjust to the respondent for there to be a public hearing; (f) it involves non-contentious matters arising in the administration of trusts or in the administration of a deceased person’s estate; or (g) the court considers a private hearing to be necessary in the interests of justice. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION

Mr Scarth applied to the Commission on 2 February 1996. He alleged a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

The Commission declared the application (no. 33745/96) partly admissible on 21 May 1998. In its report of 21 October 1998 (former Article 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE court by the government

By letter of 11 May 1999, the Government conceded that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in the circumstances of this application.","{'applicant': 'Norman Scarth', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1999}",001-58284

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) on 4 December 1998, within the three-month period laid down by former Articles 32 § 1 and 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 33745/96) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under former Article 25 by Mr Norman Scarth (“the applicant”), a British national, on 2 February 1996. The Commission’s request referred to former Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (former Article 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

Following the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with Article 5 § 4 thereof read in conjunction with Rule 100 § 1 and Rule 24 § 6 of the Rules of Court, a Panel of the Grand Chamber decided on 14 January 1999 that the case should be dealt with by a Chamber constituted within one of the Sections of the Court.

In accordance with Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the case to the Fourth Section. The Chamber ultimately constituted within the Section included Mr A. Pastor Rudruejo, Mr L. Caflisch, Mr J. Makarczyk, Mr I. Cabral Barreto, Mr V. Butkevych, Mr J. Hedigan and Mrs S. Botoucharova.

The applicant requested permission to present his own case (Rule 36 § 4 (b)). On 1 March 1999 the President of the Chamber declined to grant leave.

On the same date, the President of the Chamber invited the parties to submit a memorial on the issues in the case. The applicant submitted a memorial on 29 April 1999; on 11 May 1999 the Government conceded that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in the circumstances of the case.

On 1 June 1999 the Chamber decided not to hold a hearing in the case.

On 30 June 1999 the Government stated that they were prepared to waive the right to the presence of an ad hoc judge.

The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr H. Llewellyn, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. the circumstances of the case

The facts of the case, as found by the Commission and not contested before the Court, are as follows:

On 26 September 1994, proceedings for recovery of a debt of 697 pounds sterling (GBP) were commenced by Bradley Grange Stud Limited against the applicant in the Scarborough County Court.

By reason of Order 19, rule 3 (1), of the County Court Rules 1981 the case was referred for hearing by way of arbitration under Order 19, rule 7, of the County Court Rules.

On 8 November 1994 a preliminary hearing took place. The plaintiff did not attend, and Mr Scarth requested that the claim be struck out. The District Judge (the arbitrator) refused to do so.

Mr Scarth made an application for the main hearing to be in public and for evidence to be given on oath. This application was heard on 3 January 1995 and refused. The reasons for the refusal were not recorded formally, but in a note of 21 July 1997 prepared in the context of the Convention proceedings, District Judge Elliott made the following comments: “At this stage I can only say that it is likely that I took the view that the [applicant's] reasons as set out in his application were not in my view good reasons for the private nature of arbitration proceedings to be dispensed with. Further the sum of the dispute and the nature of the dispute were basically no different from the usual “run of the mill“ arbitration disputes heard in any county court. Lastly, at the time the arbitration hearing had been fixed, prior to the filing of the application [for the case to be heard in open court]. I cannot say with certainty the above are the reasons I gave. The earlier fixing of an arbitration hearing date would have carried little weight with me if I had considered the application had any particular merit. ...“

The arbitration hearing took place in private on 16 January 1995. On 31 January 1995 District Judge Elliott made his award in writing, finding in favour of the plaintiff.

Mr Scarth made an application for the arbitration award to be set aside on the ground that there had been “misconduct“ or “errors of law“ by the District Judge, pursuant to Order 19, rule 8 (1), of the County Court Rules 1981.

The hearing of the application to set aside took place before a Recorder in private. He refused the application on 9 May 1995 and made a costs order against Mr Scarth. These costs were subsequently assessed at GBP 1,032.76.

Mr Scarth then applied for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal alleging a lack of public hearing, misconduct by the judge and an overall unfairness of the proceedings. Mr Scarth was heard in open court and leave was refused on 9 November 1995. Lord Justice Morritt noted that the “European Convention on Human Rights is not part of our law in the way the European Community law is, and the provisions of the county court rule to which I have referred entitled the District Judge to hold the hearing in private“. He further found that the judge could not be said to have been guilty of any misconduct and rejected Mr Scarth’s allegations as to unfairness. In connection with a submission that the District Judge was wrong on one particular point of law, he continued: “That seems to me to be a matter largely of fact, because if these two cheques were handed over for value and either of them was countermanded and subsequently presented, then it would seem that there would be a cause of action on the cheque ...“.

II. relevant domestic law

Order 19, rule 3 (1), of the County Court Rules (“the Rules“), as in force at the relevant time, states that any proceedings in which the sum claimed or amount involved does not exceed GBP 1,000 shall be referred for arbitration.

Order 19, rule 7 (1), (3) and (4), of the Rules provides as follows: “(1) Any proceedings referred to arbitration shall be dealt with in accordance with the following paragraphs of this rule unless the arbitrator otherwise orders. (3) The hearing shall be informal and the strict rules of evidence shall not apply; unless the arbitrator orders otherwise, the hearing shall be held in private and evidence shall not be taken on oath. (4) At the hearing the arbitrator may adopt any method of procedure which he may consider to be fair and which gives to each party an equal opportunity to have his case presented;...“

Order 19, rule 8 (1), of the Rules reads as follows: “Where proceedings are referred to arbitration, the award of the arbitrator shall be final and may only be set aside ... on the ground that there has been misconduct by the arbitrator or that the arbitrator made an error of law.“

In monetary matters of less than GBP 5,000, and wherever the County Court judge makes his order in an appellate capacity, leave to appeal must be obtained before a County Court order may be appealed to the Court of Appeal (see RSC 1997, Order 59, rule 1/34, referring to the County Court Appeals Order 1991).

Under the Civil Procedure Rules, which came into force on 26 April 1999, hearings, including those in small claims cases, are to be held in public. There is a discretion for the court to hold a hearing in private where: (a) publicity would defeat the object of the hearing; (b) it involves matters relating to national security; (c) it involves confidential information (including information relating to personal financial matters) and publicity would damage that confidentiality; (d) a private hearing is necessary to protect the interests of any child or person suffering from mental incapacity; (e) it is a hearing of an application made without notice and it would be unjust to the respondent for there to be a public hearing; (f) it involves non-contentious matters arising in the administration of trusts or in the administration of a deceased person’s estate; or (g) the court considers a private hearing to be necessary in the interests of justice. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION

Mr Scarth applied to the Commission on 2 February 1996. He alleged a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

The Commission declared the application (no. 33745/96) partly admissible on 21 May 1998. In its report of 21 October 1998 (former Article 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE court by the government

By letter of 11 May 1999, the Government conceded that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in the circumstances of this application.","{'applicant': 'Norman Scarth', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1999}",001-58284
507,"PROCEDURE

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) on 4 December 1998, within the three-month period laid down by former Articles 32 § 1 and 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 33745/96) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under former Article 25 by Mr Norman Scarth (“the applicant”), a British national, on 2 February 1996. The Commission’s request referred to former Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (former Article 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

Following the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with Article 5 § 4 thereof read in conjunction with Rule 100 § 1 and Rule 24 § 6 of the Rules of Court, a Panel of the Grand Chamber decided on 14 January 1999 that the case should be dealt with by a Chamber constituted within one of the Sections of the Court.

In accordance with Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the case to the Fourth Section. The Chamber ultimately constituted within the Section included Mr A. Pastor Rudruejo, Mr L. Caflisch, Mr J. Makarczyk, Mr I. Cabral Barreto, Mr V. Butkevych, Mr J. Hedigan and Mrs S. Botoucharova.

The applicant requested permission to present his own case (Rule 36 § 4 (b)). On 1 March 1999 the President of the Chamber declined to grant leave.

On the same date, the President of the Chamber invited the parties to submit a memorial on the issues in the case. The applicant submitted a memorial on 29 April 1999; on 11 May 1999 the Government conceded that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in the circumstances of the case.

By letter of 11 May 1999, the Government conceded that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in the circumstances of this application.","{'applicant': 'Norman Scarth', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1999}",001-58284
508,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 28291/95) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Yaşar Kanbur (“the applicant”), on 21 July 1995.

The applicant was represented by Mrs Oya Ersoy Ataman, a lawyer practising in Ankara (Turkey). The Turkish Government did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of the criminal proceedings against him.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr Rıza Türmen, the judge elected in respect of Turkey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr Feyyaz Gölcüklü to sit as an ad hoc judge, in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).

The President of the Chamber decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the present application should be joined to other applications against the same respondent State raising the same complaints (applications nos. 26480/95, 29280/95, 26699/96, 29700/96, 29701/96, 29702/96, 29703/96, 29911/96, 29912/96, 29913/96, 31831/96, 31834/96, 31853/96, 31880/96, 31891/96, 31960/96, 32964/96, 32987/96, 32900/96, 33362/96, 33369/96, 33645/96, 34591/96, 34687/96, 39428/96 and 43362/96) (Rule 43 § 2).

By a decision of 31 August 1999, having obtained the parties’ observations, the Court declared the application admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

A. Arrest and detention of the applicant

On 5 March 1982 police officers from the Istanbul Security Directorate arrested the applicant on suspicion of membership of an illegal armed organisation, the Dev-Yol (Revolutionary Way). He was then taken to Ankara for questioning in relation to his activities in the organisation.

On 26 April 1982 the Ankara Martial Law Court (sıkıyönetim mahkemesi) ordered the applicant’s detention on remand.

B. Trial in the Ankara Martial Law Court

On 26 February 1982 the Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Martial Law Court against the applicant and 722 other defendants. The Public Prosecutor accused the applicant, inter alia, of membership of the Dev-Yol, whose object was to undermine the constitutional order and replace it with a Marxist-Leninist regime. The prosecution sought the death penalty under Article 146 § 1 of the Turkish Criminal Code.

In a judgment of 19 July 1989 the Martial Law Court convicted the applicant of membership of the Dev-Yol. It sentenced the applicant to 15 years’ imprisonment under Article 146 § 3 of the Turkish Criminal Code, permanently debarred him from employment in the civil service and placed him under judicial guardianship.

C. Proceedings on appeal

The applicant appealed.

Following promulgation of the Law of 27 December 1993, which abolished the jurisdiction of the Martial Law Courts, the Court of Cassation (yargıtay) acquired jurisdiction over the case and on 26 December 1994 the case file was transmitted to it.

On 27 December 1995 the Court of Cassation quashed the applicant’s conviction on the ground that he should have been convicted of the offence under Article 146 § 1 of the Turkish Criminal Code. It referred the case to the Ankara Assize Court (ağır ceza mahkemesi). The criminal proceedings are still pending before the latter court.","{'applicant': 'Yaşar Kanbur', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 51, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2001}",001-59855

The applicant was represented by Ms H. Çekiç, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

On 16 December 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaints under Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention concerning the absence of legal assistance during the applicant's detention in police custody, the non-communication of the opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation, the length of the proceedings and the lack of remedies in that respect. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Tekirdağ.

On 27 January 1999 the applicant was arrested and taken into custody in Istanbul on suspicion of involvement in the activities of the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party, an illegal organisation). The applicant had a forged identity card in his possession when arrested. In his police statement, taken in the absence of a lawyer, the applicant accepted the charges against him.

On 3 February 1999 he was brought before the public prosecutor and subsequently the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court, who ordered his pre-trial detention. In his statements before the public prosecutor and the judge, taken in the absence of a lawyer, the applicant denied that he had been involved in the activities of an illegal organisation.

On 11 February 1999 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant and nine other persons. The applicant was charged with membership of an illegal organisation under Article 168 § 2 of the former Criminal Code.

On 18 June 1999 the Constitution was amended and the military judges sitting on the bench of State Security Courts were replaced by civilian judges.

On 21 December 2000 Law no. 4616 on Conditional Release, Deferral of Procedure and Punishments was promulgated. On 18 July 2001 the Constitutional Court annulled Section 1 § 4 of this Law.

Of the twenty hearings held between 30 April 1999 and 14 May 2003, six were adjourned at the applicant's request or at the request of other accused. Two hearings were adjourned at the public prosecutor's request. Seven witnesses were heard in the course of the proceedings.

Between 15 May 2002 and 24 July 2002, the court awaited the enactment of a new provision to replace the annulled Section 1 § 4 of Law no. 4616.

On 14 May 2003 the Istanbul State Security Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to twelve years and six months' imprisonment.

On 31 October 2003 the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor submitted to the Court of Cassation was communicated to the applicant.

On 9 December 2003 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.

On 28 April 2004 the applicant was served with the committal order (müddetname) concerning the execution of his sentence.

By Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, published in the Official Gazette on 30 June 2004, State Security Courts were abolished. The case against the applicant and his co-accused was transferred to the Istanbul Assize Court.

On 21 October 2004 the applicant was released.

On 1 June 2005 the new Criminal Code (Law no. 5237) entered into force.

On 14 June 2005 the Istanbul Assize Court reviewed the applicant's conviction in the light of the provisions of the new Criminal Code and decided to reduce his sentence of imprisonment to six years and three months.

On 14 August 2005 the judgment became final as no appeal was made.","{'applicant': 'Ayhan Işık', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2010}",001-97995

On 3 February 1999 he was brought before the public prosecutor and subsequently the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court, who ordered his pre-trial detention. In his statements before the public prosecutor and the judge, taken in the absence of a lawyer, the applicant denied that he had been involved in the activities of an illegal organisation.

On 11 February 1999 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant and nine other persons. The applicant was charged with membership of an illegal organisation under Article 168 § 2 of the former Criminal Code.

On 18 June 1999 the Constitution was amended and the military judges sitting on the bench of State Security Courts were replaced by civilian judges.

On 21 December 2000 Law no. 4616 on Conditional Release, Deferral of Procedure and Punishments was promulgated. On 18 July 2001 the Constitutional Court annulled Section 1 § 4 of this Law.

Of the twenty hearings held between 30 April 1999 and 14 May 2003, six were adjourned at the applicant's request or at the request of other accused. Two hearings were adjourned at the public prosecutor's request. Seven witnesses were heard in the course of the proceedings.

Between 15 May 2002 and 24 July 2002, the court awaited the enactment of a new provision to replace the annulled Section 1 § 4 of Law no. 4616.

On 14 May 2003 the Istanbul State Security Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to twelve years and six months' imprisonment.

On 31 October 2003 the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor submitted to the Court of Cassation was communicated to the applicant.

On 9 December 2003 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.

On 28 April 2004 the applicant was served with the committal order (müddetname) concerning the execution of his sentence.

By Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, published in the Official Gazette on 30 June 2004, State Security Courts were abolished. The case against the applicant and his co-accused was transferred to the Istanbul Assize Court.

On 21 October 2004 the applicant was released.

On 1 June 2005 the new Criminal Code (Law no. 5237) entered into force.

On 14 June 2005 the Istanbul Assize Court reviewed the applicant's conviction in the light of the provisions of the new Criminal Code and decided to reduce his sentence of imprisonment to six years and three months.

On 14 August 2005 the judgment became final as no appeal was made.","{'applicant': 'Ayhan Işık', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2010}",001-97995
512,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 31891/96) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Erdoğan Genç (“the applicant”), on 21 May 1996.

The applicant was represented by Mrs Oya Ersoy Ataman, a lawyer practising in Ankara (Turkey). The Turkish Government did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of the criminal proceedings against him.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr Rıza Türmen, the judge elected in respect of Turkey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr Feyyaz Gölcüklü to sit as an ad hoc judge, in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).

The President of the Chamber decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the present application should be joined to other applications against the same respondent State raising the same complaints (applications nos. 26480/95, 28291/95, 29280/95, 26699/96, 29700/96, 29701/96, 29702/96, 29703/96, 29911/96, 29912/96, 29913/96, 31831/96, 31834/96, 31853/96, 31880, 31960/96, 32964/96, 32987/96, 32900/96, 33362/96, 33369/96, 33645/96, 34591/96, 34687/96, 39428/96 and 43362/96) (Rule 43 § 2).

By a decision of 31 August 1999, having obtained the parties’ observations, the Court declared the application admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

A. Arrest and detention of the applicant

On 2 December 1980 police officers from the Ankara Security Directorate arrested the applicant on suspicion of membership of an illegal armed organisation, the Dev-Yol (Revolutionary Way).

On 2 February 1981 the Ankara Martial Law Court (sıkıyönetim mahkemesi) ordered the applicant’s detention on remand.

B. Trial in the Ankara Martial Law Court

On 26 February 1982 the Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Martial Law Court against the applicant and 722 other defendants. The Public Prosecutor accused the applicant, inter alia, of membership of the Dev-Yol, whose object was to undermine the constitutional order and replace it with a Marxist-Leninist regime. The prosecution sought the death penalty under Article 146 § 1 of the Turkish Criminal Code.

On 14 December 1988 the applicant was released pending trial.

In a judgment of 19 July 1989 the Martial Law Court convicted the applicant of membership of the Dev-Yol. It sentenced the applicant to six years and eight months’ imprisonment under Article 168 § 2 of the Turkish Criminal Code.

C. Proceedings on appeal

The applicant appealed.

Following promulgation of the Law of 27 December 1993, which abolished the jurisdiction of the Martial Law Courts, the Court of Cassation (yargıtay) acquired jurisdiction over the case and on 26 December 1994 the case file was transmitted to it.

On 27 December 1995 the Court of Cassation quashed the applicant’s conviction on the ground that he should have been convicted of the offence under Article 146 § 1 of the Turkish Criminal Code. It referred the case to the Ankara Assize Court (ağır ceza mahkemesi).

514,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 42509/05) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr Thomas John Crompton (“the applicant”), on 20 November 2005.

The applicant was represented by Levys Solicitors, a firm of solicitors based in Manchester. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms H. Moynihan, Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

On 13 May 2008 the acting President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).

The parties requested an oral hearing. However, the Chamber decided not to hold a hearing in the case.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, Mr Thomas John Crompton, is a British national who was born in 1954 and lives in Stalybridge, Cheshire.

The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.

In 1989 the applicant joined the Territorial Army (“TA”) as a pay and accounts clerk, a military post, carrying out duties such as filing, photocopying and maintaining a stationery store. In July 1993 the applicant was informed that he was to be made redundant, following organisational changes in the TA pursuant to a process of civilianisation. He was subsequently informed that the clerical post which he had occupied was to become a civilian post and was to be converted to that of a technical store-man. The applicant applied for this new post, but was informed in February 1994 that he could take it only if he undertook a training course, but that all relevant training courses had been cancelled. He also applied for a number of other clerical posts within the Army but was refused for them all.

The applicant was therefore made redundant. His discharge from the Army, dated 18 February 1994, was formally made, incorrectly, on the basis that his services were no longer required. The applicant later discovered that his former duties were being carried out by an untrained civilian, while the technical store-man post remained vacant.

On 3 May 1994 the applicant complained about his redundancy to the Industrial Tribunal, but his claim was rejected because the Industrial Tribunal did not have jurisdiction over matters involving military personnel.

On 19 December 1994 the applicant claimed redress in respect of his redundancy from his Commanding Officer, under sections 180 and 181 of the Army Act 1955.

On 22 March 1995 the Commanding Officer issued a brief in which he concluded that the applicant had a weak case for redress. He further requested the Army Board of the Defence Council to determine whether the applicant was subject to military law. The applicant's solicitors, on 6 December 1996, submitted observations in reply. The matter was then placed before the Army Board.

In January 1998, the applicant applied for judicial review in respect of the Army Board's failure to determine the case within a reasonable time. His application was granted by the High Court on 2 February 1998 and the Army Board was ordered to deal with the case expeditiously.

The Army Board, without holding an oral hearing or directing a Board of Inquiry to be convened, issued its decision on 7 May 1998, refusing the applicant's claim for redress.

The applicant applied for judicial review of the decision not to hold an oral hearing or convene a Board of Inquiry.

On 3 November 1998, while the judicial review application was pending, the Army Board directed that a Board of Inquiry should be convened. The Board was convened by an order dated 10 February 1999. It sat in March 1999, considered oral and documentary evidence and issued a summary of its factual findings on 6 May 1999. It found in the applicant's favour as regards his argument that he ought to have been, but was not, given priority before five selection boards. It was anticipated that the level of compensation would be fixed by negotiation between the Army Board and the applicant.

The Army Board met to reach a determination on 11 April 2001. It issued its decision on 16 July 2001, ordering that the applicant be offered compensation in respect of the failure to offer him alternative employment within the Army. On 10 August 2001, an award of compensation was notified to the applicant but he disputed the calculation of the compensation.

In November 2001 a further offer of settlement was made to the applicant, which he rejected.

On 11 April 2003 the Army Board made a further compensation offer of GBP 94,016.67. The sum was made up of three parts: loss of salary (minus the applicant's actual earnings during the relevant period); a redundancy payment estimated on the basis that the applicant would have had an extra six years' service; and loss of pension rights, again based on a six-year period. The applicant rejected the offer on the basis that it did not include costs or a sum to compensate him for the stress he had suffered.

The applicant, acting as a litigant in person, subsequently applied for judicial review of the decision, claiming that the award had not been properly assessed. Permission was granted on 23 June 2003. The applicant advanced two criticisms: first, that the award was based on the assumption that he would have been discharged from the army six years after the date on which he was actually discharged; second, that the salary base used for the calculation of all three elements of the award was taken to be GBP 15,800 per year gross. The latter criticism was only formally advanced at the hearing itself.

On 16 October 2003 the High Court rejected the applicant's complaint regarding the six-year cut-off date. However, in light of evidence produced to the court regarding the level of the applicant's salary at the time of his redundancy, the court accepted the Army Board's undertaking to review the level of the annual salary used in its calculation and, if appropriate, to reassess the award of compensation within 35 days. Although formally the applicant was the unsuccessful party in the litigation, and as a result would normally be required to pay the costs of the Army Board, the court ordered the applicant to pay only half of the Army Board's costs partly on the ground that “the history of this matter displays an inordinate period of delay”.

On 20 November 2003, a revised offer of GBP 147,682.42 was made to the applicant. The offer was rejected.

The applicant again applied for judicial review on 11 January 2004 seeking an order requiring the Army Board to investigate and take steps towards redressing his complaint within a prescribed time-frame and damages for the losses suffered by him as a result of the Army Board's failure to perform its duties. There was a hearing on 10 February 2004 but no order was made.

On 13 April 2004, a further offer was made to the applicant in the sum of GBP 153,000.

On 26 July 2004 the applicant again applied for judicial review in respect of the delay but again, following a hearing on 10 August 2004, no order was made.

On 19 May 2005, following another application for judicial review, the High Court adjourned the case pending promulgation by the Army Board of its written decision regarding the offer of compensation.

On 24 May 2005 the Army Board issued its decision awarding the applicant compensation of GBP 153,864.47.

The applicant's application for judicial review was refused on 24 June 2005 on the ground that the Army Board's decision had brought the finality which the applicant had been seeking.

The applicant brought a fresh application for judicial review on the ground that the award of 24 May 2005 had been incorrectly reached. The application was refused on the papers on 22 September 2005. Following the applicant's renewed application and an oral hearing, permission was finally refused on 14 November 2005.","{'applicant': 'Thomas John Crompton', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2009}",001-95364

516,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 1206/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Sait Uysal and Mr İskan Osal (“the applicants”), on 20 November 2002.

The applicants were represented by Mr F. Gümüş, a lawyer practising in Diyarbakır. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

On 29 January 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicants were born in 1974 and 1972 respectively and live in Şırnak.

The applicants were taken into police custody on 27 June 1992 and 24 May 1992 respectively on suspicion of their membership of an illegal organisation, the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party). On 9 July 1992 and 8 June 1992 respectively, the applicants were brought before the investigating judge, who ordered their detention on remand.

On 1 September 1992 the Diyarbakır State Security Court Public Prosecutor filed an indictment against 49 accused persons, including the applicants. He accused the applicants of carrying out activities aimed at breaking up the unity of the State and removing part of the national territory from the State's control. The prosecutor requested the court to sentence the applicants in accordance with Article 125 of the Criminal Code.

On 12 June 1998 the applicants were released pending trial. On an unspecified date in 1998 the second applicant went abroad.

On 3 July 1998 the Diyarbakır State Security Court, composed of three judges including a military judge, delivered its judgment. The court found the applicants guilty of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation and sentenced them to three years and nine months' imprisonment, pursuant to Article 169 of the Criminal Code. The applicants appealed.

In the meantime, on 18 June 1999 the Constitution was amended and the military judges sitting on the bench of the State Security Courts were replaced by civilian judges.

On 14 October 1999 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the Diyarbakır State Security Court.

On 30 December 1999 the Diyarbakır State Security Court, composed of three civilian judges, recommenced the trial of the applicants. The court further decided to summon all the accused, including the applicants, to the next hearing to submit their views on the Court of Cassation's decision.

During the proceedings, the court repeatedly summoned the applicants; however, the second applicant did not respond. As a result, on 24 December 2002 the Diyarbakır State Security Court decided that the file concerning the second applicant be separated and given another file number. It further found the first applicant guilty of membership of a terrorist organisation and sentenced him to twelve years and six months' imprisonment pursuant to Article 168 of the Criminal Code.

On 10 April 2003 the Court of Cassation held that the first applicant's prison sentence should be recalculated and quashed the judgment of the Diyarbakır State Security Court.

On 30 September 2003 the Diyarbakır State Security Court recalculated the first applicant's prison sentence and decided that he should be sentenced to eight years and four months' imprisonment. This decision became final on 26 February 2004.

On 7 May 2004 State Security Courts were abolished following a constitutional amendment and the second applicant's case was transferred to the Diyarbakır Assize Court.

On 14 July 2006 the court ordered an arrest warrant for the second applicant.

The case originated in an application (no. 1206/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Sait Uysal and Mr İskan Osal (“the applicants”), on 20 November 2002.

The applicants were represented by Mr F. Gümüş, a lawyer practising in Diyarbakır. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

On 29 January 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicants were born in 1974 and 1972 respectively and live in Şırnak.

The applicants were taken into police custody on 27 June 1992 and 24 May 1992 respectively on suspicion of their membership of an illegal organisation, the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party). On 9 July 1992 and 8 June 1992 respectively, the applicants were brought before the investigating judge, who ordered their detention on remand.

On 1 September 1992 the Diyarbakır State Security Court Public Prosecutor filed an indictment against 49 accused persons, including the applicants. He accused the applicants of carrying out activities aimed at breaking up the unity of the State and removing part of the national territory from the State's control. The prosecutor requested the court to sentence the applicants in accordance with Article 125 of the Criminal Code.

On 12 June 1998 the applicants were released pending trial. On an unspecified date in 1998 the second applicant went abroad.

On 3 July 1998 the Diyarbakır State Security Court, composed of three judges including a military judge, delivered its judgment. The court found the applicants guilty of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation and sentenced them to three years and nine months' imprisonment, pursuant to Article 169 of the Criminal Code. The applicants appealed.

In the meantime, on 18 June 1999 the Constitution was amended and the military judges sitting on the bench of the State Security Courts were replaced by civilian judges.

On 14 October 1999 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the Diyarbakır State Security Court.

On 30 December 1999 the Diyarbakır State Security Court, composed of three civilian judges, recommenced the trial of the applicants. The court further decided to summon all the accused, including the applicants, to the next hearing to submit their views on the Court of Cassation's decision.

During the proceedings, the court repeatedly summoned the applicants; however, the second applicant did not respond. As a result, on 24 December 2002 the Diyarbakır State Security Court decided that the file concerning the second applicant be separated and given another file number. It further found the first applicant guilty of membership of a terrorist organisation and sentenced him to twelve years and six months' imprisonment pursuant to Article 168 of the Criminal Code.

On 10 April 2003 the Court of Cassation held that the first applicant's prison sentence should be recalculated and quashed the judgment of the Diyarbakır State Security Court.

On 30 September 2003 the Diyarbakır State Security Court recalculated the first applicant's prison sentence and decided that he should be sentenced to eight years and four months' imprisonment. This decision became final on 26 February 2004.

On 7 May 2004 State Security Courts were abolished following a constitutional amendment and the second applicant's case was transferred to the Diyarbakır Assize Court.

On 14 July 2006 the court ordered an arrest warrant for the second applicant. According to the information in the case file, the trial is still pending before the Diyarbakır Assize Court.","{'applicant': 'Sait Uysal', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2007}",001-83979
518,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 2917/05) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Hüseyin Özel (“the applicant”), on 16 December 2004.

The applicant was represented by Mr H. Aygün, a lawyer practising in Tunceli. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

The applicant alleged under Article 6 of the Convention that the court fees he had been required to pay were so excessive as to deny him his right of access to court.

On 19 January 2010 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the applicant’s right of access to court to the Government. It was decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of that complaint at the same time (Article 29 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Tunceli.

On 8 April 2003 the applicant made a request to the Governorship of Tunceli to be informed about the living conditions in his village, which he claimed to have had to leave in 1994 for security reasons. On 14 April 2003 the Governorship of Tunceli informed the applicant that he could move back to his village and that he would receive services and financial support from the Governorship for doing so. Subsequently, on 18 June 2003 the Ministry of Public Works and Settlement (Bayındırlık ve İskan Bakanlığı) conducted an on-site inspection and issued a report which indicated that the houses in the village were old and ruined.

On 4 December 2003 the applicant, together with several other residents of the village, applied to the Ministry of the Interior through the Governorship of Tunceli requesting compensation for the damage to his property that had occurred over the ten years he had had to live away from his village.

On 7 January 2004 the Governorship of Tunceli submitted a report to the Ministry of the Interior. The report stated that the residents had left the village of their own accord in 1994 and that the Administration had no liability regarding the damage to the property. It indicated that, in any event, there was no record or title deed to prove the applicant’s ownership of property in the village. The report was later approved by the Ministry of the Interior.

On 3 March 2004 the applicant instituted compensation proceedings in the Malatya Administrative Court against the Ministry of the Interior. He requested a total of 150,000,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) (approximately 90,000 euros (EUR) at the time), claiming that he had not been allowed to go back to his village for nine years and that the administration was indirectly liable for the damage that had occurred over that time. The applicant also requested legal aid to cover the court fees.

On 16 March 2004 the Malatya Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s request for legal aid, merely stating that he did not fulfil the conditions laid down in Article 465 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

On 22 March 2004 the court notified the applicant that he was required to pay a court fee of TRL 2,035,100,000 (approximately EUR 1,200) and a postal fee of TRL 40,000,000 (approximately EUR 25) within thirty days. The applicant objected to the court’s decision regarding his request for legal aid. On 31 May 2004 the Administrative Court rejected his objection. The court stated that its decisions regarding legal aid were final.

On 2 June 2004 the court once more informed the applicant that he had to pay the required fees within thirty days in order to continue the proceedings and that the proceedings would be discontinued if he failed to do so.

On 15 July 2004 the Administrative Court discontinued the proceedings as the applicant had not paid the court fees.","{'applicant': 'Hüseyin Özel', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2012}",001-108462

The case originated in an application (no. 18753/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Mehmet Tanay (“the applicant”), on 11 February 2004.

The applicant was represented by Mrs Fatma Kalsen Demirdaş, a lawyer practising in Tunceli. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

The applicant alleged, in particular, that a factual error made by the Court of Cassation had infringed his right of access to court, in violation of Article 6 of the Convention.

On 20 November 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3 of the Convention).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Istanbul.

On 18 November 1997 the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways (hereinafter “the Directorate”) expropriated 4,309 square metres of the applicant’s land in Tunceli. The expropriation decision was communicated to the applicant on 16 August 2000. According to the domestic procedure, the applicant had thirty days, which began the day after the decision was communicated to him, to ask for an increase in the amount of compensation.

On 1 September 2000 a certain Mr Sezai Yıldız, who had been authorised by the applicant to appoint a lawyer for him, had a power of attorney drawn up at a notary public, appointing Mrs Fatma Kalsen Demirdaş as legal counsel to represent the applicant.

On 19 September 2000 the applicant, with the assistance of his lawyer Mrs Demirdaş, brought an action before the Tunceli Civil Court (hereinafter the “Tunceli Court”), seeking increased compensation. Mrs Demirdaş requested the court to accept the case despite the expiry of the statutory time-limit on 17 September 2000, as she had had health problems preventing her lodging the case earlier.

On 9 November 2000 the Tunceli Court asked the Forensic Medicine Institute in Ankara to clarify whether Mrs Demirdaş had had health problems at the relevant time and whether those problems had been of a nature to render it impossible for her to come to the court house and lodge the applicant’s case within the statutory time-limit.

On 22 May 2001 the Erzurum branch of the Forensic Medicine Institute forwarded to the Tunceli Court a number of medical reports, confirming that Mrs Demirtaş had been ill between 23 August 2000 and 17 September 2000 and had thus been unable to lodge the case within the statutory time-limit.

The Tunceli Court accepted the medical report and began examining the merits of the case. In the course of the proceedings it had regard to the zone plan, the expropriation documentation, two principal and two additional expert reports, and awarded the applicant additional compensation on 31 May 2001. The Directorate appealed.

On 3 March 2003 the Court of Cassation quashed the decision, quoting the applicant’s name, instead of that of his representative, as the person who had been ill. The Court of Cassation stated that the applicant had given a power of attorney to Fatma Kalsen Demirdaş so that, even if he had been ill, Mrs Kalsen Demirdaş could have lodged the claim on his behalf within the statutory time-limit. The Court of Cassation consequently held that the case had been time-barred on 17 September 2000.

In an application for rectification Mrs Demirdaş argued that it was she who had been ill, not her client. The Court of Cassation had therefore made a factual error which should be rectified.

On 12 May 2003, the Court of Cassation held that “amending the factual error would not affect the outcome”, and dismissed the rectification request.

On 4 July 2003 the Tunceli Court concurred with the Court of Cassation’s decision and dismissed the case. On 13 November 2003 the Court of Cassation upheld the final ruling.","{'applicant': 'Mehmet Tanay', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 50, 57, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2008}",001-90131

On 19 September 2000 the applicant, with the assistance of his lawyer Mrs Demirdaş, brought an action before the Tunceli Civil Court (hereinafter the “Tunceli Court”), seeking increased compensation. Mrs Demirdaş requested the court to accept the case despite the expiry of the statutory time-limit on 17 September 2000, as she had had health problems preventing her lodging the case earlier.

On 22 May 2001 the Erzurum branch of the Forensic Medicine Institute forwarded to the Tunceli Court a number of medical reports, confirming that Mrs Demirtaş had been ill between 23 August 2000 and 17 September 2000 and had thus been unable to lodge the case within the statutory time-limit.

The Tunceli Court accepted the medical report and began examining the merits of the case. In the course of the proceedings it had regard to the zone plan, the expropriation documentation, two principal and two additional expert reports, and awarded the applicant additional compensation on 31 May 2001.

522,"PROCEDURE

The case was brought before the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 13 March 1986, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 10426/83) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 30 March 1983 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Bengt Pudas. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 6 § 1 and 13 (art. 6-1, art. 13).

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant expressed the wish to take part in the proceedings before the Court and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).

The Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mr. G. Lagergren, the elected judge of Swedish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 3 (b)). On 19 March 1986, the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely Mr. J. Cremona, Mr. B. Walsh, Mr. R. Macdonald, Mr. C. Russo and Mr. J. Gersing (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 4) (art. 43). Mr. J. De Meyer, substitute judge, subsequently replaced Mr. Cremona, who was prevented from taking part in the consideration of the case (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1).

Having assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 5), Mr. Ryssdal consulted, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Swedish Government (“the Government“), the Delegate of the Commission and Mr. Pudas’ lawyer regarding the need for a written procedure (Rule 37 § 1). On 16 June 1986, he directed that the said Agent and lawyer should each be entitled to file a memorial by 16 August and that thereafter the Delegate should have one month to lodge a memorial in reply.

The Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 6 August 1986. On 19 August, he received a letter dated 14 August from the Agent of the Government stating that they had nothing to add to the observations they had previously submitted to the Court in a letter of 11 April 1986. On 2 September, the Secretary to the Commission indicated that the Delegate did not intend to present any written observations.

On 26 February 1987, the President set 23 March down as the date for the opening of the oral proceedings, having first consulted, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicant (Rule 38).

The hearing was held in public at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. Immediately before it opened, the Court had held a preparatory meeting. There appeared before the Court:

for the Government Mr. H. Corell, Ambassador, Under-Secretary for Legal and Consular Affairs, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Agent, Mr. P. Löfmarck, Under-Secretary for Legal Affairs, Ministry of Transport and Communications, Mr. H. Berglin, Legal Adviser, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Advisers;

for the Commission Mr. Gaukur Jörundsson, Delegate;

for the applicant Mr. G. Ravnsborg, Lecturer in Law at the University of Lund, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mr. Corell for the Government, by Mr. Gaukur Jörundsson for the Commission and by Mr. Ravnsborg for the applicant, as well as their replies to its questions.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, Mr. Bengt Pudas, is a Swedish citizen born in 1959. He lives at Hedenäset, which is situated in the Municipality of Övertorneå and the County of Norrbotten, in the North of Sweden.

On 1 February 1980, the County Administrative Board (länsstyrelsen) of Norrbotten granted him a taxi traffic licence, and, on 20 May, a licence to carry passengers and their goods on specified interurban routes (linjetrafik). The licences were expressed to be valid until further notice.

The applicant commenced his combined taxi and interurban traffic business on 20 May 1980. Two vehicles (a Peugeot 505 - mainly for the taxi traffic; and a seven-seater Citroën - mainly for the interurban traffic) were used in the business, which occupied the applicant, his father and a third driver on a part-time basis. By way of interurban traffic, the applicant offered a service of two journeys a week at scheduled times. This service was available on request and had to be ordered one day in advance.

A. County Traffic Company’s application to the County Administrative Board

On 2 April 1981, the County Traffic Company of Norrbotten (länstrafiken i Norrbotten AB) (see paragraph 20 below) filed an application with the County Administrative Board (see paragraph 19 below) for a licence to provide interurban transport on routes including those covered by Mr. Pudas’ second licence. The County Traffic Company at the same time requested that this licence be revoked, as well as a licence held since 1973 by a certain Mr. Wälimaa. In support of its application, the Company submitted that two traffic services in two different regions were to be united into one regular service with a single time-table, to be provided by the bus service business owned by Mr. Wälimaa and others. The applicant opposed the revocation of his licence.

B. Decision to revoke Mr. Pudas’ licence

On 17 August 1981, the County Administrative Board granted the County Traffic Company a licence, valid as from 1 September 1981, to provide interurban transport of passengers and goods on the routes indicated in its request. In another decision on the same day, the Board revoked the applicant’s and Mr. Wälimaa’s licences for interurban traffic, inter alia on the following grounds: “The plans for the future transport service offered by the County Company include a regular bus service which is to be created between the places in question. Such a plan will, in the opinion of the Board, enable a better network of routes to be created for the area and transport to be co-ordinated in one route. Bearing this in mind, it is the opinion of the Board that the transport service in the area will be improved in such a way that the licence applied for by the County Company cannot be refused. Consequently, the former licences, issued to (the applicant) and Mr. Wälimaa, shall be revoked.“ By virtue of a subsequent order, Mr. Pudas’ licence was to cease to be valid as from the date on which the revocation of 17 August became final. Shortly thereafter, the County Traffic Company contracted out to the company owned by Mr. Wälimaa and others the running of a bus service on the routes covered by its new licence.

C. Appeals by Mr. Pudas against the revocation of his licence

The applicant lodged an appeal with the Board of Transport (transportrådet), in which he alleged, inter alia, the following. The County Traffic Company’s application for a licence for the routes covered by his licence had been motivated not by any public interest in improving the transport service, but by an arrangement between the Company and Mr. Wälimaa (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above). Only very serious reasons, such as misconduct of the licence-holder, could justify revocation. When revoking his licence, the County Administrative Board had failed to take due account of his interests. Finally, the transport service on the routes concerned was not likely to be improved simply by being carried out by Mr. Wälimaa and others instead of by himself. The Board of Transport rejected the appeal on 14 May 1982.

Mr. Pudas thereupon lodged a further appeal with the Government (Ministry of Transport and Communications), in which he referred to his arguments submitted to the Board of Transport.

The Government dismissed the appeal on 21 October 1982. In response to a further request from the applicant, the Government declined, on 13 January 1983, to review their previous decision.","{'applicant': 'Bengt Pudas', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1987}",001-57562

It originated in an application (no. 10426/83) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 30 March 1983 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Bengt Pudas. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 6 § 1 and 13 (art. 6-1, art. 13).

In response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant expressed the wish to take part in the proceedings before the Court and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).

Cremona, Mr. B. Walsh, Mr. R. Macdonald, Mr. C. Russo and Mr. J. Gersing (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 4) (art. 43). Mr. J. De Meyer, substitute judge, subsequently replaced Mr. Cremona, who was prevented from taking part in the consideration of the case (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1).

Having assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 5), Mr. Ryssdal consulted, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Swedish Government (“the Government“), the Delegate of the Commission and Mr. Pudas’ lawyer regarding the need for a written procedure (Rule 37 § 1). On 16 June 1986, he directed that the said Agent and lawyer should each be entitled to file a memorial by 16 August and that thereafter the Delegate should have one month to lodge a memorial in reply.

The Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 6 August 1986. On 19 August, he received a letter dated 14 August from the Agent of the Government stating that they had nothing to add to the observations they had previously submitted to the Court in a letter of 11 April 1986. On 2 September, the Secretary to the Commission indicated that the Delegate did not intend to present any written observations.

On 26 February 1987, the President set 23 March down as the date for the opening of the oral proceedings, having first consulted, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicant (Rule 38).

The hearing was held in public at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. Immediately before it opened, the Court had held a preparatory meeting. There appeared before the Court:

for the Government Mr. H. Corell, Ambassador, Under-Secretary for Legal and Consular Affairs, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Agent, Mr. P. Löfmarck, Under-Secretary for Legal Affairs, Ministry of Transport and Communications, Mr. H. Berglin, Legal Adviser, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Advisers;

for the Commission Mr. Gaukur Jörundsson, Delegate;

for the applicant Mr. G. Ravnsborg, Lecturer in Law at the University of Lund, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mr. Corell for the Government, by Mr. Gaukur Jörundsson for the Commission and by Mr. Ravnsborg for the applicant, as well as their replies to its questions.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant, Mr. Bengt Pudas, is a Swedish citizen born in 1959. He lives at Hedenäset, which is situated in the Municipality of Övertorneå and the County of Norrbotten, in the North of Sweden.

On 1 February 1980, the County Administrative Board (länsstyrelsen) of Norrbotten granted him a taxi traffic licence, and, on 20 May, a licence to carry passengers and their goods on specified interurban routes (linjetrafik). The licences were expressed to be valid until further notice.

The applicant commenced his combined taxi and interurban traffic business on 20 May 1980. Two vehicles (a Peugeot 505 - mainly for the taxi traffic; and a seven-seater Citroën - mainly for the interurban traffic) were used in the business, which occupied the applicant, his father and a third driver on a part-time basis. By way of interurban traffic, the applicant offered a service of two journeys a week at scheduled times. This service was available on request and had to be ordered one day in advance.

A. County Traffic Company’s application to the County Administrative Board

On 2 April 1981, the County Traffic Company of Norrbotten (länstrafiken i Norrbotten AB) (see paragraph 20 below) filed an application with the County Administrative Board (see paragraph 19 below) for a licence to provide interurban transport on routes including those covered by Mr. Pudas’ second licence. The County Traffic Company at the same time requested that this licence be revoked, as well as a licence held since 1973 by a certain Mr. Wälimaa. In support of its application, the Company submitted that two traffic services in two different regions were to be united into one regular service with a single time-table, to be provided by the bus service business owned by Mr. Wälimaa and others. The applicant opposed the revocation of his licence.

B. Decision to revoke Mr. Pudas’ licence

On 17 August 1981, the County Administrative Board granted the County Traffic Company a licence, valid as from 1 September 1981, to provide interurban transport of passengers and goods on the routes indicated in its request. In another decision on the same day, the Board revoked the applicant’s and Mr. Wälimaa’s licences for interurban traffic, inter alia on the following grounds: “The plans for the future transport service offered by the County Company include a regular bus service which is to be created between the places in question. Such a plan will, in the opinion of the Board, enable a better network of routes to be created for the area and transport to be co-ordinated in one route. Bearing this in mind, it is the opinion of the Board that the transport service in the area will be improved in such a way that the licence applied for by the County Company cannot be refused. Consequently, the former licences, issued to (the applicant) and Mr. Wälimaa, shall be revoked.“ By virtue of a subsequent order, Mr. Pudas’ licence was to cease to be valid as from the date on which the revocation of 17 August became final. Shortly thereafter, the County Traffic Company contracted out to the company owned by Mr. Wälimaa and others the running of a bus service on the routes covered by its new licence.

C. Appeals by Mr. Pudas against the revocation of his licence

The applicant lodged an appeal with the Board of Transport (transportrådet), in which he alleged, inter alia, the following. The County Traffic Company’s application for a licence for the routes covered by his licence had been motivated not by any public interest in improving the transport service, but by an arrangement between the Company and Mr. Wälimaa (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above). Only very serious reasons, such as misconduct of the licence-holder, could justify revocation. When revoking his licence, the County Administrative Board had failed to take due account of his interests. Finally, the transport service on the routes concerned was not likely to be improved simply by being carried out by Mr. Wälimaa and others instead of by himself. The Board of Transport rejected the appeal on 14 May 1982.

Mr. Pudas thereupon lodged a further appeal with the Government (Ministry of Transport and Communications), in which he referred to his arguments submitted to the Board of Transport.

The Government dismissed the appeal on 21 October 1982. In response to a further request from the applicant, the Government declined, on 13 January 1983, to review their previous decision.","{'applicant': 'Bengt Pudas', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 44, 32, 34, 112, 49, 45, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'SWE', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1987}",001-57562

The case originated in an application (no. 24874/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Ünsal Öztürk (“the applicant”), on 7 July 2004.

Until March 2008 the applicant was represented by lawyers at the Kurdish Human Rights Project (KHRP) in London. Subsequently, he was represented by Mr Levent Kanat, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.

The applicant alleged, in particular, that the refusal of the national courts to lift a confiscation order for a number of books published by his company violated his right to freedom of expression within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention.

On 10 March 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Ankara. He is the owner of “Yurt Books and Publishing”, a small independent firm that has published numerous books in Turkey.

In the 1990s a number of books published by the applicant's company were found to contain propaganda in breach of various provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3712), as well as “insults to the memory of Atatürk” in breach of Law no. 5816. He was convicted and served a total period of one year, five months and twenty days in prison and paid the equivalent of 5,121 euros (EUR) in fines. Most of the books in question were confiscated. On 21 December 1994 he introduced an application with the Court in relation to that conviction and the confiscation of the books. On 4 October 2005 the Court found a violation of Articles 7 and 10 of the Convention (see Ünsal Öztürk v. Turkey, no. 29365/95, 4 October 2005).

Following the repeal of section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act in July 2003, the applicant made applications to the First Chamber of the Ankara State Security Court on various dates in 2003 and asked for the confiscation orders to be lifted.

The First Chamber of the Ankara State Security Court rejected the claims and the applicant lodged objections against those rejections with the Second Chamber of the same court.

The Second Chamber of the Ankara State Security Court lifted the confiscation orders in respect of a number of the books but held that, as the confiscation orders had already been executed, there were no books to return.

On 9 January 2004 the Second Chamber of the Ankara State Security Court held in respect of sixteen books that, although section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act had been repealed, the contents of those books amounted not only to “separatist propaganda” but were also unlawful “under various laws”, and rejected the objection.

On 22 November 2005 a further decision was adopted by the Ankara Assize Court in respect of the same sixteen books. Having regard “to the legislation in force” and “considering that the contents of the books might be in contravention of section 7(2) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act” it refused the applicant's request for the lifting of the confiscation order in respect of the sixteen books.

The applicant appealed against the decision of 22 November 2005. The prosecutor at the Court of Cassation also requested that the decision be quashed because he considered that rejecting the applicant's request on account of the assumption that the contents of the books “might be unlawful”, rather than examining the substance of the applicant's request in the light of the legal developments, was not in accordance with the law and procedure.

On 8 April 2006 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal lodged by the applicant.","{'applicant': 'Ünsal Öztürk', 'articles': [91, 34, 49, 48, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2011}",001-103304

526,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in two applications (nos. 15809/02 and 25624/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two British nationals, Mr Gerard O’Halloran and Mr Idris Richard Francis (“the applicants”), on 3 April 2002 and 15 November 2001 respectively.

The applicants, one of whom had been granted legal aid, were represented by Mr J. Welch of Liberty, London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

Mr O’Halloran alleged that he had been convicted solely or mainly on account of the statement he had been compelled to provide under threat of a penalty similar to the offence itself. Mr Francis complained that having been compelled to provide evidence of the offence he was suspected of committing had infringed his right not to incriminate himself. Both applicants relied on Article 6 §§ 1 and 2 of the Convention.

The applications were allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). On 26 October 2004 the applications were joined and on 25 October 2005 they were declared admissible by a Chamber of that Section composed of Josep Casadevall, Nicolas Bratza, Matti Pellonpää, Stanislav Pavlovschi, Lech Garlicki, Ljiljana Mijovič, Ján Šikuta, judges, and Michael O’Boyle, Section Registrar. On 11 April 2006 the Chamber relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber, none of the parties having objected to relinquishment (Article 30 of the Convention and Rule 72).

The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 27 §§ 2 and 3 of the Convention and Rule 24. On 19 January 2007 Luzius Wildhaber’s term as President of the Court came to an end. Jean-Paul Costa succeeded him in that capacity and took over the presidency of the Grand Chamber in the present case (Rule 9 § 2). Luzius Wildhaber and Matti Pellonpää continued to sit following the expiry of their terms of office, in accordance with Article 23 § 7 of the Convention and Rule 24 § 4.

The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits.

A hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 27 September 2006 (Rule 59 § 3). There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr D.Walton, Agent, Mr D. Perry, Counsel, Ms L. Clarke, Mr M. Magee, Mr J. Moore, Advisers; (b) for the applicants Mr B. Emmerson QC, Counsel, Mr J. Welch, Solicitor, Mr D. Friedman, Adviser, Mr G. O’Halloran, Mr I. Francis, Applicants. The Court heard addresses by Mr Emmerson and Mr Perry and their answers to questions put by judges.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicants were born in 1933 and 1939 and live in London and Petersfield respectively.

A. Mr O’Halloran (application no. 15809/02)

On 7 April 2000, at 4.55 a.m., a vehicle of which the applicant was the registered keeper, registration number T61 TBX, was caught on a speed camera driving at 69 miles per hour (mph) on the M11 motorway where the temporary speed limit was 40 mph.

On 17 April 2000, the police camera enforcement unit of the Essex Constabulary wrote to the applicant: “I have photographic evidence that the driver of T61 TBX failed to comply with the speed limit ... It is intended to institute proceedings against the driver for the offence of failing to comply with the speed limit ... You have been named as the driver of the vehicle at the time of the alleged offence and have a legal obligation to comply with the provisions of the notice contained on page 2. I must warn you that if you fail to comply with this demand within 28 days you will commit an offence and be liable on conviction to a maximum penalty similar to that of the alleged offence itself – a fine of £1,000 and 3-6 penalty points.”

The attached Notice of Intended Prosecution informed the applicant that it was intended to institute proceedings against the driver of the vehicle. He was asked to furnish the full name and address of the driver of the vehicle on the relevant occasion or to supply other information that was in his power to give and which would lead to the driver’s identification. He was again informed that a failure to provide information was a criminal offence under section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988.

The applicant answered the letter confirming that he was the driver at the relevant time.

On 27 March 2001 the applicant was summoned to attend North Essex Magistrates’ Court where he was tried for driving in excess of the speed limit. Prior to the trial, the applicant sought to exclude the confession made in response to the Notice of Intended Prosecution, relying on sections 76 and 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 read in conjunction with Article 6 of the Convention. His application was refused in the light of the decision of the Privy Council in Brown v. Stott [2001] 2 WLR 817. Thereafter the prosecution relied upon the photograph of the speeding vehicle and the admission obtained as a result of the section 172 demand. The applicant was convicted and fined 100 pounds sterling (GBP), ordered to pay GBP 150 costs and his licence was endorsed with six penalty points.

On 11 April 2001 the applicant asked the magistrates to state a case for the opinion of the High Court: “Whether in the circumstances of this case, the admission that the defendant was indeed the driver should have been excluded under sections 76 and 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 having regard to the Human Rights Act and the recent cases decided by the European Court as he had been obliged to incriminate himself?”

On 23 April 2001 the magistrates’ clerk informed the applicant that the magistrates refused to state a case as the issue had already been decided definitively by the Privy Council in Brown v. Stott (cited above) and by the High Court in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Wilson ([2001] EWHC Admin 198).

On 19 October 2001 the applicant’s application for judicial review of the magistrates’ decision was refused.

B. Mr Francis (application no. 25624/02)

A car of which the applicant was the registered keeper was caught on speed camera on 12 June 2001 driving at 47 mph where the speed limit was 30 mph.

On 19 June 2001 the Surrey Police sent the applicant a Notice of Intended Prosecution in the following terms: “In accordance with section 1, Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, I hereby give you notice that proceedings are being considered against the driver of Alvis motor vehicle registration mark EYX 622 ... This allegation is supported by means of photographic/recorded video evidence. You are recorded as the owner/keeper/driver or user for the above vehicle at the time of the alleged offence, and you are required to provide the full name and address of the driver at the time and location specified. Under section 172 of the Road Traffic Act you are required to provide the information specified within 28 days of receipt of this notice. Failure to supply this information may render you liable to prosecution. The penalty on conviction for failure to supply the information is similar to that for the offence itself, i.e. a fine and penalty points.”

On 17 July 2001 the applicant wrote to the Surrey Police invoking his right to remain silent and privilege against self-incrimination.

On 18 July 2001 the Surrey Police informed the applicant that the appeal in Brown v. Stott, cited above, held that section 172 did not infringe the said rights.

The applicant refused to supply the information.

On 28 August 2001 the applicant was summoned to the Magistrates’ Court for failing to comply with section 172(3) of the Road Traffic Act 1988. He obtained an adjournment.

On 9 November 2001 the Magistrates’ Court agreed to a further postponement, apparently with reference to the applicant’s proceeding with an application in Strasbourg. The applicant wrote to the Court on 15 November 2001, relying on Article 6 §§ 1 and 2 of the Convention.

On 8 February 2002 the Magistrates’ Court cancelled the postponement and fixed the trial for 15 April 2002, on which date the applicant was convicted and fined GBP 750 with GBP 250 costs and three penalty points. He states that the fine was substantially heavier than that which would have been imposed if he had pleaded guilty to the speeding offence.","{'applicant': 'Gerard O’Halloran', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'GRANDCHAMBER', 'year': 2007}",001-81359

The applicants were born in 1933 and 1939 and live in London and Petersfield respectively.

He states that the fine was substantially heavier than that which would have been imposed if he had pleaded guilty to the speeding offence.","{'applicant': 'Gerard O’Halloran', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'GRANDCHAMBER', 'year': 2007}",001-81359
528,"PROCEDURE

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) on 16 September 1996, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 25942/94) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by Mr Paul Matthew Coyne, a British citizen, on 23 November 1994. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).

The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 4 (b)). On 17 September 1996, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr C. Russo, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr R. Pekkanen, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha and Mr L. Wildhaber (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 5). Subsequently, Mr I. Foighel, substitute judge, replaced Mr Macdonald, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1).

As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 6), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the United Kingdom Government (“the Government”), the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 § 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 28 April 1997.

In a letter dated 14 March 1997, the Government expressed the view that it would not be necessary to hold oral proceedings and, in a letter dated 8 April 1997, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Court that the Commission’s Delegate also saw no reason to hold a hearing. The applicant, however, in a letter dated 28 April 1997, stated that if the claim for either just satisfaction or costs was contested, he would welcome the opportunity to make representations at a hearing before the Court. On 28 May 1997, the Court decided that it would be necessary to hold an oral hearing, limited to issues under Article 50 of the Convention.

On 24 April 1997 the President decided that legal aid should be granted to the applicant for the proceedings before the Court (Rule 4 of the Addendum to Rules of Court A).

In two letters dated 29 April 1997, the Government indicated that they had no submissions to make on the merits and offered to settle the case on the basis of the payment of the applicant’s reasonable legal costs and expenses. This offer was rejected by the applicant on 6 May 1997.

By a letter dated 7 May 1997, the Government requested the Registrar to obtain from the applicant a breakdown of the legal costs and expenses incurred by him in the Strasbourg proceedings. Mr Coyne responded in a letter dated 16 May 1997. In a letter dated 9 June 1997, the Government commented in detail on the applicant’s claims under Article 50 of the Convention. The applicant submitted written observations in response on 13 June 1997.

In accordance with the Court’s decision (see paragraph 5 above), a hearing limited to issues under Article 50 of the Convention took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 June 1997. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr M.R. Eaton, Deputy Legal Adviser, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr J. Eadie, Counsel; (b) for the Commission Mr N. Bratza, Delegate; (c) for the applicant Mr G. Blades, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr Bratza, Mr Blades and Mr Eadie.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. Circumstances of the case

The applicant, Mr Paul Matthew Coyne, was born in 1972 and lives in Bedford.

He joined the Royal Air Force (“RAF”) in 1990. In June 1992, when he was serving as a non-commissioned officer in Brüggen, Germany, he applied for premature voluntary release from the force. This was granted with a view to his final discharge on 9 December 1992. However, following a police investigation into his financial activities in Germany, his final release was refused and the decision was taken to charge him with various offences of forgery and deception and to try him by RAF court martial in Brüggen.

In August 1993 Mr Coyne was charged, pursuant to section 70 (1) of the Air Force Act 1955, with four civilian criminal offences (the second and fourth charges being expressed as alternatives to the first and third charges) of using a false instrument together with obtaining services by deception contrary to the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 and the Theft Act 1968. The charges were connected to a false application for a bank loan.

The convening officer (see paragraphs 24–29 below) was the Air Officer Commanding no. 2 Group, RAF, Rheindahlen and as such was the senior commander of all air force personnel serving in Germany (including approximately one thousand officers). On 26 January 1994 the convening officer convened a district court martial, appointing all three members of the court martial by name. The president was a wing commander of the RAF Station, Uxbridge. He was a permanent president and subordinate in rank to the convening officer. The other two members of the court martial were a squadron leader and a flight lieutenant, both of whom were stationed in Germany and subordinate in rank to, and within the chain of command of, the convening officer.

The prosecuting officer was appointed by the convening officer from the Directorate of Legal Services and was also within the convening officer’s chain of command. A judge advocate was appointed by the Judge Advocate General’s Office (see paragraphs 32–33 below).

The court martial took place at the RAF Station, Brüggen on 26‑28 January 1994. After pleading not guilty to all the charges against him, Mr Coyne was found not guilty on the first and second charges, guilty on the third (under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981) and consequently no finding was made on the fourth charge. He was sentenced to nine months’ detention, dismissal from the air force and reduction to the ranks.

On 31 January 1994 he presented a petition against conviction and sentence to the confirming officer (see paragraph 36 below), claiming that the judge advocate had erred in his summing up of the case, that the finding of guilt on one charge was inconsistent with his acquittal on another charge and that the sentence was excessive. However, on 7 March 1994, his conviction and sentence were confirmed by the confirming officer who had obtained the advice of a judge advocate (not the trial judge advocate).

On 8 March 1994 Mr Coyne presented an appeal petition against conviction and sentence to the Defence Council (see paragraphs 37–38 below). The Air Force Board, having obtained the advice of the Judge Advocate General, informed the applicant’s legal representative on 26 May 1994 of its decision to reject the petition.

The applicant’s subsequent application for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence to the Courts Martial Appeal Court (see paragraphs 39–44 below) was accepted by a single judge of that court, not on any of the grounds presented by the applicant, but on the basis of a question raised by the single judge as to whether the judge advocate had properly advised the court martial as to what was required to be proven to establish that an instrument was “false”. On 11 October 1994, the Courts Martial Appeal Court rejected Mr Coyne’s appeal, on the grounds that the judge advocate had properly advised the court martial.

No reasons were given for the decisions of the court martial, the confirming officer or the Air Force Board. The applicant was legally represented before the Courts Martial Appeal Court.","{'applicant': 'Paul Matthew Coyne', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1997}",001-58097

530,"PROCEDURE

The case was brought before the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 13 July 1989, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in three applications (nos. 12244/86, 12245/86 and 12383/86) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) of the Convention on 16 June 1986 by Mr Bernard Fox and Ms Maire Campbell and on 2 September 1986 by Mr Samuel Hartley, who are all three Irish citizens. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision from the Court as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 5 and 13 (art. 5, art. 13) of the Convention.

In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent them (Rule 30).

The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir Vincent Evans, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 3 (b)). On 23 August 1989, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other five members, namely Mr J. Cremona, Mr J. Pinheiro Farinha, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr S.K. Martens and Mrs E. Palm (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 4) (art. 43). Subsequently, Mr R. Bernhardt, substitute judge, replaced Mr Macdonald, who was unable to take part in the consideration of the case (Rule 24 § 1).

Mr Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 5) and, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the United Kingdom Government (“the Government“), the Delegate of the Commission and the representative of the applicants on the need for a written procedure (Rule 37 § 1). Thereafter, in accordance with the orders and directions of the President, the registry received the Government’s memorial on 19 December 1989, the applicants’ memorial on 10 January 1990, the appendices to that memorial two days later and the applicants’ claims for just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention on 9 March 1990. By letter received on 8 February 1990 the Secretary to the Commission advised the Registrar that the Delegate did not propose to file a memorial in reply.

After consulting, through the Registrar, those who would be appearing before the Court, the President directed on 21 December 1989 that the oral proceedings should open on 26 March 1990 (Rule 38).

The hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Buildings, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court.

for the Government Mr M. Wood, Legal Counsellor, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr B. Kerr, Q.C., Mr N. Bratza, Q.C., Counsel;

for the Commission Mr C. Rozakis, Delegate;

for the applicants Mr R. Weir, Q.C., Mr S. Treacy, Barrister-at-Law, Counsel, Mr P. Madden, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr Kerr for the Government, by Mr Rozakis for the Commission and by Mr Weir for the applicants, as well as their replies to its questions.

On the occasion of the hearing and on various dates thereafter a number of documents were filed by the applicants and the Government relating to the costs and expenses claimed under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention.

AS TO THE FACTS

I. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

A. As regards Mr Fox and Mrs Campbell

The first and second applicants, Mr Bernard Fox and Ms Maire Campbell, are husband and wife but separated. Both reside in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

On 5 February 1986 they were stopped by the police in Belfast and brought to Woodbourne Royal Ulster Constabulary (“RUC“) station, where a full search of the vehicle in which they were travelling was carried out. Twenty-five minutes after their arrival at the police station, at 3.40 p.m., they were formally arrested under section 11 (1) of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978 (“the 1978 Act“; see paragraph 16 below). They were informed that they were being arrested under this section and that this was because the arresting officer suspected them of being terrorists. They were also told that they could be detained for up to 72 hours. They were taken to Castlereagh Police Office, where they were separately interviewed by the police on the same day between 8.15 p.m. and 10.00 p.m.

During their detention Mr Fox and Ms Campbell were asked about their suspected involvement that day in intelligence gathering and courier work for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (“Provisional IRA“). They were also questioned about their suspected membership of this organisation. According to the Government, the information underlying the suspicion against them was already known to the police when they stopped their car. No charges were brought against either applicant. The first applicant was released at 11.40 a.m. on 7 February 1986 and the second applicant five minutes later. Excluding the time taken to bring them to the police station, the first applicant had thus been detained 44 hours and the second applicant 44 hours and 5 minutes.

On being arrested both Mr Fox and Ms Campbell were shown the notice drawn up for persons held in police custody which explained their rights. They were not brought before a judge or given any opportunity to apply for release on bail. On 6 February they both initiated proceedings for habeas corpus but were released before the applications came on for hearing before a judge.

Mr Fox had been convicted in 1979 of several explosives offences, for which he received concurrent sentences of 12 years’ imprisonment, and of belonging to the IRA, for which he received a concurrent sentence of 5 years. Ms Campbell received an 18 months’ suspended sentence in 1979 after being convicted of involvement in explosives offences.

B. As regards Mr Hartley

The third applicant, Mr Samuel Hartley, resides in Waterfoot, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. On 18 August 1986 he was arrested at his home, in his parents’ presence, at 7.55 a.m. He was informed at the time of his arrest that he was being arrested under section 11 (1) of the 1978 Act as he was suspected of being a terrorist. He was taken to Antrim police station where, on arrival, he was shown a copy of the notice for persons held in police custody. He was interviewed there by the police between 11.05 a.m. and 12.15 p.m.

Mr Hartley was suspected of involvement in a kidnapping incident which had taken place earlier that month in Ballymena when a young man and woman were forcibly taken away by masked armed men. Those involved in the kidnapping were thought to have connections with the Provisional IRA. The motive behind the kidnapping was believed to have been an attempt to force the young woman to retract an allegation of rape made the previous year as a result of which a person had been convicted and sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment. The Government said at the Commission hearing that their record of the first interview with Mr Hartley showed that he was questioned about terrorist activities in a specific small, geographical area, and about his involvement with the Provisional IRA. The record is not more detailed than that, but the area in question was where the kidnapping took place. The applicant Hartley denied any involvement in the kidnapping incident but he has not contradicted the Government’s assertion that he was asked about it. No charges were brought against him. He was released on 19 August 1986 at 2.10 p.m. after 30 hours and 15 minutes in detention. He brought no proceedings in connection with his arrest or detention.","{'applicant': 'Bernard Fox', 'articles': [91, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1990}",001-57721

B. As regards Mr Hartley

The third applicant, Mr Samuel Hartley, resides in Waterfoot, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. On 18 August 1986 he was arrested at his home, in his parents’ presence, at 7.55 a.m. He was informed at the time of his arrest that he was being arrested under section 11 (1) of the 1978 Act as he was suspected of being a terrorist. He was taken to Antrim police station where, on arrival, he was shown a copy of the notice for persons held in police custody. He was interviewed there by the police between 11.05 a.m. and 12.15 p.m.

Mr Hartley was suspected of involvement in a kidnapping incident which had taken place earlier that month in Ballymena when a young man and woman were forcibly taken away by masked armed men. Those involved in the kidnapping were thought to have connections with the Provisional IRA. The motive behind the kidnapping was believed to have been an attempt to force the young woman to retract an allegation of rape made the previous year as a result of which a person had been convicted and sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment. The Government said at the Commission hearing that their record of the first interview with Mr Hartley showed that he was questioned about terrorist activities in a specific small, geographical area, and about his involvement with the Provisional IRA. The record is not more detailed than that, but the area in question was where the kidnapping took place. The applicant Hartley denied any involvement in the kidnapping incident but he has not contradicted the Government’s assertion that he was asked about it. No charges were brought against him. He was released on 19 August 1986 at 2.10 p.m. after 30 hours and 15 minutes in detention. He brought no proceedings in connection with his arrest or detention.","{'applicant': 'Bernard Fox', 'articles': [91, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 49, 51, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 1990}",001-57721
532,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 31960/96) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Ali İhsan Pekdaş (“the applicant”), on 7 June 1996.

The applicant was represented by Mr Mehdi Bektaş, a lawyer practising in Ankara (Turkey). The Turkish Government did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of the criminal proceedings against him.

The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).

The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr Rıza Türmen, the judge elected in respect of Tukey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr Feyyaz Gölcüklü to sit as an ad hoc judge, in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).

The President of the Chamber decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the present application should be joined to other applications against the same respondent State raising the same complaints (applications nos. 26480/95, 28291/95, 29280/95, 26699/96, 29700/96, 29701/96, 29702/96, 29703/96, 29911/96, 29912/96, 29913/96, 31831/96, 31834/96, 31853/96, 31880/96, 31891/96, 32987/96, 32900/96, 32964/96, 33362/96, 33369/96, 33645/96, 34591/96, 34687/96, 39428/96 and 43362/96) (Rule 43 § 2).

By a decision of 31 August 1999, having obtained the parties’ observations, the Court declared the application admissible.

The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

A. Arrest and detention of the applicant

On 25 November 1980 police officers from the Ankara Security Directorate arrested the applicant on suspicion of membership of an illegal armed organisation, the Dev-Yol (Revolutionary Way).

On 6 February 1981 the Ankara Martial Law Court (sıkıyönetim mahkemesi) ordered the applicant’s detention on remand.

B. Trial in the Ankara Martial Law Court

On 26 February 1982 the Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Martial Law Court against the applicant and 722 other defendants. The Public Prosecutor accused the applicant, inter alia, of membership of the Dev-Yol, whose object was to undermine the constitutional order and replace it with a Marxist-Leninist regime. The prosecution sought the death penalty under Article 146 § 1 of the Turkish Criminal Code.

On 21 March 1984 the Ankara Martial Law Court ordered the applicant’s release pending trial.

In a judgment of 19 July 1989 the Martial Law Court convicted the applicant of membership of the Dev-Yol. It sentenced the applicant to eight years’ imprisonment under Article 168 § 2 of the Turkish Criminal Code.

C. Proceedings on appeal

The applicant appealed to the Military Court of Cassation (askeri yargıtay).

Following promulgation of the Law of 27 December 1993, which abolished the jurisdiction of the Martial Law Courts, the Court of Cassation (yargıtay) acquired jurisdiction over the case and on 26 December 1994 the case file was transmitted to it.

On 27 December 1995 the Court of Cassation quashed the applicants’ conviction. It held, under Article 102 of the Turkish Criminal Code, that the criminal proceedings against the applicant should be discontinued since the prosecution was time‑barred.","{'applicant': 'Ali İhsan Pekdaş', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 51, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2001}",001-59859

534,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 19859/04) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a British national, Mr Richard Anderson (“the applicant”), on 27 May 2004.

The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Willmott of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

On 15 January 2008 the Acting President of the Fourth Section to which the case had been allocated decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).

THE FACTS

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

1. The background to the applicant’s civil proceedings

The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Glasgow. He is an advocate by profession. He owned a flat in a tenement building in Edinburgh. A number of the flats in the building were also owned by a commercial property company. In August 1988, when the proprietors of the building failed to carry out repairs mandated by the city council under statutory notices, the city council itself instructed works to be carried out (provided for by section 99 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982). It sought advice from a private architect, awarded the contract for the repairs to a private preservation company and apportioned the cost of the repairs among the various proprietors of the building. In October 1988, a fire occurred in the building which damaged part of the applicant’s flat and part of the flat below belonging to the commercial property company. Whilst the applicant was living elsewhere, the commercial property company instructed repair work. The applicant claimed that both sets of repairs constituted trespass to his property, that in each case the repairs were in fact inadequate and unsatisfactory, and that he was entitled to damages in the sum of GBP 100,000.

2. Proceedings in the Sheriff Court

When the applicant refused to pay the council for his share of the repair costs, the council brought proceedings in the Sheriff Court (the civil court of general jurisdiction). The applicant filed a counter-claim alleging that the council had instructed further repairs that had damaged his property. The applicant further sought referral of the whole case to the Court of Session (the highest civil court in Scotland). On 14 November 1994 the Sheriff Court upheld the council’s claim, rejected the applicant’s counter-claim and found that the case did not meet the criterion for referral to the Court of Session. On 11 May 1995, the applicant’s appeal to the Sheriff Principal was rejected. In 1998, the applicant then brought proceedings against the architect and chief executive of the preservation company for contempt of court in relation to an alleged failure to produce documents in the initial action. By judgments of 17 February 1999, the Sheriff Court rejected the applicant’s claims.

3. Proceedings in the Court of Session

On 26 March 1997, the applicant obtained a summons to bring proceedings against the commercial property company (“the first defenders”) and the city council (“the second defenders”) in the Outer House of the Court of Session, alleging that the statutory notices were invalid on grounds of fraud and illegal conspiracy. The second defenders were served on 15 April 1997. The first defenders were served on 14 May 1997. Defences were lodged by both defenders on 12 June 1997. Between that date and 7 January 1998 the record in the case (the parties’ written pleadings) was open and closed on a number of occasions at the request of the parties and with the leave of the court to allow for adjustment of their pleadings.

The applicant was then informed by the court that, since part of his claim challenged one of the orders made in the Sheriff Court proceedings, he was required to intimate a copy of the closed record to the relevant sheriff clerk. On 26 February 1998, the court gave him leave to do so. There was then further correspondence between the parties as to the future procedure in the case, which led the applicant to apply to the court first, for an order for disclosure of certain documents and second, for a warrant to direct the relevant sheriff clerk to transmit the record of the Sheriff Court proceedings to the Court of Session. On 15 July 1998, the applicant’s motion to this effect was adjourned to 22 September 1998. On the latter date, the motion was granted by way of interlocutor. This was done when the first defenders, despite their opposition to the motion, failed to appear. On 2 October 1998, the Lord Ordinary granted the first defenders leave to reclaim (appeal) to the Inner House against the interlocutor of 22 September 1998 in so far as it related to the disclosure of documents.

On 8 October 1998, the Inner House directed the parties to lodge their grounds of appeal within 28 days. On 4 November 1998, the first defenders lodged their grounds of appeal. It appears that, by oversight, the first defenders failed to apply for a hearing.

On 5 November 1999, the Inner House allowed the applicant to amend his pleadings and allowed the other parties to lodge answers within 21 days. On 7 December 1999, on the first defenders’ unopposed motion, the Inner Court appointed the case to the Summar Roll (the list of appeals and other business before it). On 3 February 2000, the Inner House allowed the second defenders’ answer to be received late. The interlocutory appeal was then to be heard in one day, 26 May 2000, but this date was vacated when, on 20 April 2000, the applicant explained to the court that he believed a two day hearing would be necessary. On 9 June 2000, the hearing was then fixed for 15 and 16 March 2001. On 7 February 2001, the applicant advised the court that a one-day hearing would be sufficient. The interlocutory appeal was duly heard on 15 March 2001 and, in a judgment given the same day, the Inner House allowed the first defenders’ reclaiming motion and remitted the case back to the Lord Ordinary in the Outer House.

On 20 March 2001, upon remittal to the Outer House, further directions were given for disclosure. On 14 September 2001, on the motion of the first defenders, the court appointed the case to the procedure roll for a debate (hearing) on pleas-in-law. After two dates for that debate were vacated, a two-day hearing was fixed for 20 and 21 June 2002. On 15 May 2002, the court allowed the applicant to lodge further supplementary arguments alleging a lack of candour in the defenders’ pleading but refused his motion for further disclosure. The case was heard on 21 June 2002. As a result of that hearing, the applicant’s action was dismissed on 4 September 2002 by the Outer House. In a written judgment, the Lord Ordinary found the applicant’s claims to be unfounded and unspecified.

The applicant appealed to the Inner House. The appeal was listed for 18 and 19 November 2003. On 4 November 2003, the Inner House refused the applicant’s motion for leave to amend his appeal. However, on 13 November, it allowed him to abandon his appeal against the second defenders and proceed only against the first defenders. The appeal was heard on 18 and 19 November 2003. The appeal was unanimously dismissed on 11 December 2003, the court finding that the applicant’s pleadings lacked specification. The applicant was found liable for the first defenders’ costs on 18 December 2003.

In June 2002 the applicant also sought to bring proceedings in the Court of Session against the solicitors acting for the council in the Sheriff Court proceedings. Unable to obtain a solicitor who would provide the necessary signature on the summons, the applicant petitioned the Court of Session for leave to proceed without the signature. Leave was refused on the papers on 25 July 2002. Complaints made in relation to the solicitors and advocates representing the council were dismissed by their respective professional bodies and then by the Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman on 13 November 2001 and 4 July 2003, respectively.","{'applicant': 'Richard Anderson', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'GBR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2010}",001-97149

536,"PROCEDURE

The case originated in an application (no. 73038/01) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Hiyasettin Altın (“the applicant”), on 26 July 2001.

The applicant was represented by Mr E. Kanar and Ms Y. Başara, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

On 31 March 2004 the Court decided to communicate the application. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

The applicant filed observations on the admissibility and merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Government submitted their observations outside the time-limit. They have therefore not been admitted to the case file.

On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section (Rule 52 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Muş.

On 11 May 1994 the applicant was arrested and placed in custody by officers from the anti-terrorism branch of the Istanbul Security Directorate on suspicion of his membership of an illegal organisation, namely the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers’ Party).

On 19 May 1994 he was brought before the public prosecutor and then the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court. The same day, the investigating judge ordered the applicant’s detention on remand.

In an indictment dated 1 June 1994, the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant and eleven others for being members of the PKK. The prosecutor requested that the applicant be sentenced pursuant to Article 168 § 2 of the Criminal Code and Section 5 of Law No. 3713 (the Anti-Terrorism Law).

On 29 May 1997 the applicant was convicted as charged by the Istanbul State Security Court and sentenced to twelve years and six months’ imprisonment.

On 14 December 1998 the Court of Cassation quashed the applicant’s conviction on the ground that the State Security Court had delivered its judgment without obtaining a final statement from the applicant, and thus had restricted the applicant’s defence rights. The case was remitted to the Istanbul State Security Court for a further examination and the applicant remained in custody.

On 16 March 1999 the Istanbul State Security Court held its first hearing.

In the course of the criminal proceedings the applicant made numerous submissions for his release pending trial. He claimed that he was innocent and had been held in detention on remand for an excessive period, contrary to international norms. The court dismissed his request for release at each of the nine hearings held between 11 August 1994 and 28 November 1995 without indicating any reason. At each of the thirty-five hearings held between 1 February 1996 and 17 April 2001, it dismissed the request due to “the state of the evidence and the content of the case file”.

In the meantime, the applicant’s lawyer challenged his client’s continued detention before another court.

The case originated in an application (no. 73038/01) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Hiyasettin Altın (“the applicant”), on 26 July 2001.

The applicant was represented by Mr E. Kanar and Ms Y. Başara, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.

On 31 March 2004 the Court decided to communicate the application. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

The applicant filed observations on the admissibility and merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Government submitted their observations outside the time-limit. They have therefore not been admitted to the case file.

On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section (Rule 52 § 1).

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Muş.

On 11 May 1994 the applicant was arrested and placed in custody by officers from the anti-terrorism branch of the Istanbul Security Directorate on suspicion of his membership of an illegal organisation, namely the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers’ Party).

On 19 May 1994 he was brought before the public prosecutor and then the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court. The same day, the investigating judge ordered the applicant’s detention on remand.

In an indictment dated 1 June 1994, the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant and eleven others for being members of the PKK. The prosecutor requested that the applicant be sentenced pursuant to Article 168 § 2 of the Criminal Code and Section 5 of Law No. 3713 (the Anti-Terrorism Law).

On 29 May 1997 the applicant was convicted as charged by the Istanbul State Security Court and sentenced to twelve years and six months’ imprisonment.

On 14 December 1998 the Court of Cassation quashed the applicant’s conviction on the ground that the State Security Court had delivered its judgment without obtaining a final statement from the applicant, and thus had restricted the applicant’s defence rights. The case was remitted to the Istanbul State Security Court for a further examination and the applicant remained in custody.

On 16 March 1999 the Istanbul State Security Court held its first hearing.

In the course of the criminal proceedings the applicant made numerous submissions for his release pending trial. He claimed that he was innocent and had been held in detention on remand for an excessive period, contrary to international norms. The court dismissed his request for release at each of the nine hearings held between 11 August 1994 and 28 November 1995 without indicating any reason. At each of the thirty-five hearings held between 1 February 1996 and 17 April 2001, it dismissed the request due to “the state of the evidence and the content of the case file”.

In the meantime, the applicant’s lawyer challenged his client’s continued detention before another court. In his petition of 7 November 2000, he stated that his client had been detained for six years and six months, despite the absence of any danger that he would destroy the evidence, which had all been submitted to the case file, or that he would abscond. The court dismissed the request on similar grounds (paragraph 13 in fine above), namely “having regard to the nature of the offence, the state of the evidence and the content of the case file”.

The Istanbul State Security Court held twenty-eight more hearings before delivering its final judgment. At fifteen of them, where the court merely reviewed the applicant’s continued detention, the applicant was not present. For the others, the court fixed them at approximately two month intervals.

On 12 April 2001 the State Security Court adhered to its first judgment and convicted the applicant of the offence.

On 8 October 2001 the Court of Cassation upheld this judgment.","{'applicant': 'Hiyasettin Altın', 'articles': [91, 34, 51, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 53, 34, 44, 32, 34, 50, 57, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 44, 32, 34, 54, 34, 93], 'countries': 'TUR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2005}",001-69128

The case originated in an application (no. 1176/10) against the Kingdom of Norway lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Norwegian national, Mr Jørgen Kristiansen (“the applicant”), on 23 December 2009.

The applicant was represented by Mr K.M. Berg, a lawyer practising in Oslo. The Norwegian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr M. Emberland of the Attorney General’s Office (Civil Matters) as their agent, assisted by Mr H. Kolderup, Attorney.

The applicant alleged that in criminal proceedings leading to his conviction he had not been afforded a fair hearing by an impartial tribunal as required by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

On 17 July 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.

THE FACTS

I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE

The applicant was born in 1984 and lives in Borgenhaugen.

A. Applicant’s conviction

1. The City Court

On 18 September 2008 the Sarpsborg City Court (tingrett) convicted the applicant inter alia on a charge of attempted rape committed against Ms A during the night of 9 March 2008 in a car parked near a petrol station. At the time Ms A and the applicant had been seventeen and twenty-three years old, respectively. Together they had left a party at Mr C’s home in order to buy mineral water at the petrol station. The applicant had borrowed the car from Mr D, Ms A’s boyfriend. They had both attended a party at Mr C’s home one week before but they did not know each other. The applicant and Ms A had been sitting in the car talking and listening to music for a while before they had decided to return to the party. As the car’s battery was flat it would not start. The applicant had called a friend, Mr B, who worked as a taxi driver and who collected him and Ms A and brought them back to Mr C’s home. The City Court did not find credible the applicant’s explanation that he and Ms A had kissed and to a little extent touched one another voluntarily and that he had not forcibly attempted to rape her.

2. The High Court

By a judgment of 5 February 2009, the Borgarting High Court (lagmannsrett), hearing the applicant’s appeal with a jury, convicted him on the attempted rape charge and sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment on account of this (and a number of other offences of which he had been charged in the same proceedings). It ordered him to pay 60,000 Norwegian kroner (NOK) (approximately 7,500 euros at that time) in compensation to Ms A for non-pecuniary damage.

In its reasoning the High Court described in detail how the applicant, after he had called Mr B (who could not come straight away), had attempted to obtain sexual contact with Ms A by force. It stated that in the beginning, when the applicant had tried to kiss and touch her, Ms A had told him that she was not interested because she was the girlfriend of Mr D and slapped the applicant. The applicant had not stopped, but had moved himself over to her seat and held her arms behind the neck support. Ms A tried to defend herself and after a while the situation involved into a fight between them, in which she had been physically inferior and had to come to terms with the situation. The applicant had had such control over Ms A that he was also able to call Mr B again and the fact that Mr B was on his way had not hindered the applicant from continuing, until the moment when the lights from Mr B’s car appeared.

The High Court also noted that Mr B had testified that he had not noticed anything conspicuous about Ms A; she had been cheerful and friendly and her clothes had not been in disorder. However, this did not suggest, in the High Court’s view, that she had not been exposed to sexual abuse causing a great burden on her. She had managed to pull herself together when Mr B had arrived. Her reaction had been expressed vis-à-vis others only when she and the applicant had returned to Mr C’s home, where Ms A cried and was in great despair. Her boyfriend, Mr D, had understood that something was very wrong. After opening herself gradually to him, she had explained what had happened.

B. Motion for disqualification of juror

During a pause in the oral proceedings before the High Court, after both Ms A and the applicant had been heard, one of the jurors –“J” – had informed the presiding judge of the High Court about her previous contacts with Ms A. When the hearing resumed after the break, the presiding judge informed the public prosecutor, counsel for the defence and Ms A’s assistant advocate (bistandsadvokat) about the matter. Counsel for the defence requested that J be disqualified from taking part in the further proceedings on grounds of lack of impartiality. Ms A’s assistant advocate (bistandsadvokat for offeret) supported counsel’s motion. The public prosecutor expressed understanding for the motion without taking a stance.

The applicant’s contestation of J’s impartiality was made with reference to section 108 of the Administration of Courts Act (domstolloven – see paragraph 23 below) and Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. According to the relevant court record, counsel for the defence had stated: “Counsel stated that he had been informed by the High Court’s presiding judge and the other members of the court, that [J] [who was a member of the jury] had informed the presiding judge that she was the foster mother of a child who had been a pupil in the same school class as the victim, and that she had had contacts with the victim in connection with birthday celebrations at her home. [J] thought that she could recall knowing that the victim had participated in class outings which [J] had attended as a parent. The presiding judge had further informed counsel that [J] did not have any further personal knowledge of the victim, but she had a personal view [bilde] of her as a calm girl. Last time there had been any contact between the victim and [J] dated far back in time.”

The High Court withdrew to deliberate on the issue and decided that J ought not to withdraw. It pointed out that a member might be disqualified if the person in question had particular reasons for identifying himself or herself with the victim or if there were any other circumstances to the effect that he or she had a prejudging attitude because of prior knowledge of the victim. However, that was not the situation in the present case. The High Court observed that “the jury member had formed a picture [bilde] of the victim from many years ago where she at the time had experienced her as a quiet and calm person”. However, it could not see that this was capable of influencing J’s attitude to the sustainability of the victim’s explanation and J’s assessment of the question of guilt in the case. In particular the contact had been sporadic many years ago and the High Court did not find that such a contact was capable of influencing, in one way or another, the assessment in the criminal case. The High Court had special regard to the fact that the parties to the case had requested that J recuse herself, but it found the absence of partiality so clear in this case that this could not be decisive.

Consequently, juror J took part in the entire trial before the High Court, including the jury’s deliberations and vote on the questions put to it by the presiding judge on the charge of attempted rape. After the jury had answered the questions in the affirmative and the professional judges had confirmed the jury’s verdict, she took part, together with the other two jurors selected by drawing of lots, in the deliberations with the professional judges on the question of sentencing and award of compensation of non-pecuniary damage to the victim Ms A.

C. Procedural appeal to the Supreme Court

The applicant appealed against the High Court’s procedure to the Supreme Court (Høyesterett), arguing that J’s participation had been incompatible with section 108 of the Administration of Courts Act and Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

By a judgment of 26 June 2009 the Supreme Court, by three votes to two, rejected the applicant’s appeal.

The majority did not consider that J’s knowledge of the victim from her attendance at birthday parties and class outings with the victim in itself indicated an identification with the victim or weakened in any other way the confidence in J’s impartiality. It had involved sporadic contacts, not a personal knowledge, and the contacts dated several years back in time. Neither had counsel for the defence alleged before the Supreme Court that this was a sufficient ground for disqualification.

Nor could the mere fact that the juror in question had formed a picture of the victim disqualify her. When it was deemed acceptable that a juror may have some prior knowledge of a victim, it ought also to be accepted that the juror has formed a picture of the latter. Therefore, the question was whether the fact that the juror had stated this to the presiding judge and the matter had thereafter been repeated by the defence counsel in open court would bring the matter into a different light.

In the majority’s view, a statement that one had a picture of a young woman one had previously met when she was younger, as a quiet and calm girl, could hardly be perceived as an expression of an assessment of the person’s credibility or give the impression of identification with, or particular sympathies for, her. This was a neutral value judgment; an observation about the child’s inconspicuous conduct. It could possibly be maintained that one could draw the conclusion that a calm girl would hardly make a fuss without any justifications for doing so, which suggested that Ms A’s crying and despair after she returned after the drive was a sign that she had actually been exposed to an attempted rape. However, there was no basis for such a conclusion and there was in any event no reason for attaching weight to such a possibility. J’s information about Ms A had emerged after she had given evidence to the High Court for one hour. At that point, the jury, including J, had a good opportunity to form an independent and updated picture of the victim as a person. That defence counsel and the assistant advocate had requested that J withdraw could not be decisive. Accordingly, there were no particular circumstances capable of calling into doubt J’s impartiality for the purposes of section 108 of the Administration of Courts Act, as interpreted in the light of Article 6 of the Convention.

The minority considered that the assessment of the impartiality issue ought to take as a starting point that the case concerned a serious and stigmatising accusation against the defendant. There was a lot at stake for the victim, as she could easily perceive a verdict acquitting the defendant to mean that the jury believed that she had made an unfounded and serious accusation against the defendant. The minority shared the majority’s view (see paragraph 16 above) that previous contacts between the victim and J could not, of their own, disqualify the latter. What was decisive was whether J’s statement made after she had heard the evidence given by the accused and the witness describing the latter as a “quiet and calm person” would lead to a different conclusion. In this regard, the minority took as a starting point that the credibility of the victim was the decisive evidence in this case. An additional factor of lesser importance was how the surrounding persons had perceived the victim’s behaviour after the alleged rape attempt.

The timing of J’s statement was of considerable importance. For the persons present in court it could seem conspicuous that the juror, after having heard both the accused and the victim’s evidence, had not confined herself to informing about her previous contacts with A but had found it correct to add that she had experienced the victim as a “quiet and calm person”. The timing of J’s affirmation could easily have given the impression that J expressed a positive assessment of the victim.

Whilst a literal interpretation of “quiet and calm person” was not directly related to the credibility assessment, the affirmation was positively loaded and, when expressed just after the victim had given evidence, could at least easily have been perceived as if, according to J, one had to do with a person who would not make a fuss and thus would not make a false accusation about an attempt of rape. That J had expressed a view on how she had perceived her “at the time”, was of secondary importance. This was a nuance that could easily be overlooked by a person overhearing her statement and which, having regard to the timing, could hardly be perceived as a reservation with regard to A’s current character.

An important, albeit not decisive, consideration under section 108 of the Administration of Courts Act was also the fact that both counsel for the defence and the assistant advocate had demanded that J recuse herself. Under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, “the standpoint of the accused [was] important but not decisive”; in this case the “fear” of lack of impartiality by the applicant had been “objectively justified” (see Ferrantelli and Santangelo v. Italy, 7 August 1996, § 58, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996‑III).","{'applicant': 'Jørgen Kristiansen', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'NOR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2015}",001-159211

By a judgment of 5 February 2009, the Borgarting High Court (lagmannsrett), hearing the applicant’s appeal with a jury, convicted him on the attempted rape charge and sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment on account of this (and a number of other offences of which he had been charged in the same proceedings). It ordered him to pay 60,000 Norwegian kroner (NOK) (approximately 7,500 euros at that time) in compensation to Ms A for non-pecuniary damage.

In its reasoning the High Court described in detail how the applicant, after he had called Mr B (who could not come straight away), had attempted to obtain sexual contact with Ms A by force. It stated that in the beginning, when the applicant had tried to kiss and touch her, Ms A had told him that she was not interested because she was the girlfriend of Mr D and slapped the applicant. The applicant had not stopped, but had moved himself over to her seat and held her arms behind the neck support. Ms A tried to defend herself and after a while the situation involved into a fight between them, in which she had been physically inferior and had to come to terms with the situation. The applicant had had such control over Ms A that he was also able to call Mr B again and the fact that Mr B was on his way had not hindered the applicant from continuing, until the moment when the lights from Mr B’s car appeared.

The High Court also noted that Mr B had testified that he had not noticed anything conspicuous about Ms A; she had been cheerful and friendly and her clothes had not been in disorder. However, this did not suggest, in the High Court’s view, that she had not been exposed to sexual abuse causing a great burden on her. She had managed to pull herself together when Mr B had arrived. Her reaction had been expressed vis-à-vis others only when she and the applicant had returned to Mr C’s home, where Ms A cried and was in great despair. Her boyfriend, Mr D, had understood that something was very wrong. After opening herself gradually to him, she had explained what had happened.

B. Motion for disqualification of juror

During a pause in the oral proceedings before the High Court, after both Ms A and the applicant had been heard, one of the jurors –“J” – had informed the presiding judge of the High Court about her previous contacts with Ms A. When the hearing resumed after the break, the presiding judge informed the public prosecutor, counsel for the defence and Ms A’s assistant advocate (bistandsadvokat) about the matter. Counsel for the defence requested that J be disqualified from taking part in the further proceedings on grounds of lack of impartiality. Ms A’s assistant advocate (bistandsadvokat for offeret) supported counsel’s motion. The public prosecutor expressed understanding for the motion without taking a stance.

The applicant’s contestation of J’s impartiality was made with reference to section 108 of the Administration of Courts Act (domstolloven – see paragraph 23 below) and Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. According to the relevant court record, counsel for the defence had stated: “Counsel stated that he had been informed by the High Court’s presiding judge and the other members of the court, that [J] [who was a member of the jury] had informed the presiding judge that she was the foster mother of a child who had been a pupil in the same school class as the victim, and that she had had contacts with the victim in connection with birthday celebrations at her home. [J] thought that she could recall knowing that the victim had participated in class outings which [J] had attended as a parent. The presiding judge had further informed counsel that [J] did not have any further personal knowledge of the victim, but she had a personal view [bilde] of her as a calm girl. Last time there had been any contact between the victim and [J] dated far back in time.”

The High Court withdrew to deliberate on the issue and decided that J ought not to withdraw. It pointed out that a member might be disqualified if the person in question had particular reasons for identifying himself or herself with the victim or if there were any other circumstances to the effect that he or she had a prejudging attitude because of prior knowledge of the victim. However, that was not the situation in the present case. The High Court observed that “the jury member had formed a picture [bilde] of the victim from many years ago where she at the time had experienced her as a quiet and calm person”. However, it could not see that this was capable of influencing J’s attitude to the sustainability of the victim’s explanation and J’s assessment of the question of guilt in the case. In particular the contact had been sporadic many years ago and the High Court did not find that such a contact was capable of influencing, in one way or another, the assessment in the criminal case. The High Court had special regard to the fact that the parties to the case had requested that J recuse herself, but it found the absence of partiality so clear in this case that this could not be decisive.

Consequently, juror J took part in the entire trial before the High Court, including the jury’s deliberations and vote on the questions put to it by the presiding judge on the charge of attempted rape. After the jury had answered the questions in the affirmative and the professional judges had confirmed the jury’s verdict, she took part, together with the other two jurors selected by drawing of lots, in the deliberations with the professional judges on the question of sentencing and award of compensation of non-pecuniary damage to the victim Ms A.

C. Procedural appeal to the Supreme Court

The applicant appealed against the High Court’s procedure to the Supreme Court (Høyesterett), arguing that J’s participation had been incompatible with section 108 of the Administration of Courts Act and Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

By a judgment of 26 June 2009 the Supreme Court, by three votes to two, rejected the applicant’s appeal.

The majority did not consider that J’s knowledge of the victim from her attendance at birthday parties and class outings with the victim in itself indicated an identification with the victim or weakened in any other way the confidence in J’s impartiality. It had involved sporadic contacts, not a personal knowledge, and the contacts dated several years back in time. Neither had counsel for the defence alleged before the Supreme Court that this was a sufficient ground for disqualification.

Nor could the mere fact that the juror in question had formed a picture of the victim disqualify her. When it was deemed acceptable that a juror may have some prior knowledge of a victim, it ought also to be accepted that the juror has formed a picture of the latter. Therefore, the question was whether the fact that the juror had stated this to the presiding judge and the matter had thereafter been repeated by the defence counsel in open court would bring the matter into a different light.

In the majority’s view, a statement that one had a picture of a young woman one had previously met when she was younger, as a quiet and calm girl, could hardly be perceived as an expression of an assessment of the person’s credibility or give the impression of identification with, or particular sympathies for, her. This was a neutral value judgment; an observation about the child’s inconspicuous conduct. It could possibly be maintained that one could draw the conclusion that a calm girl would hardly make a fuss without any justifications for doing so, which suggested that Ms A’s crying and despair after she returned after the drive was a sign that she had actually been exposed to an attempted rape. However, there was no basis for such a conclusion and there was in any event no reason for attaching weight to such a possibility. J’s information about Ms A had emerged after she had given evidence to the High Court for one hour. At that point, the jury, including J, had a good opportunity to form an independent and updated picture of the victim as a person. That defence counsel and the assistant advocate had requested that J withdraw could not be decisive. Accordingly, there were no particular circumstances capable of calling into doubt J’s impartiality for the purposes of section 108 of the Administration of Courts Act, as interpreted in the light of Article 6 of the Convention.

The minority considered that the assessment of the impartiality issue ought to take as a starting point that the case concerned a serious and stigmatising accusation against the defendant. There was a lot at stake for the victim, as she could easily perceive a verdict acquitting the defendant to mean that the jury believed that she had made an unfounded and serious accusation against the defendant. The minority shared the majority’s view (see paragraph 16 above) that previous contacts between the victim and J could not, of their own, disqualify the latter. What was decisive was whether J’s statement made after she had heard the evidence given by the accused and the witness describing the latter as a “quiet and calm person” would lead to a different conclusion. In this regard, the minority took as a starting point that the credibility of the victim was the decisive evidence in this case. An additional factor of lesser importance was how the surrounding persons had perceived the victim’s behaviour after the alleged rape attempt.

The timing of J’s statement was of considerable importance. For the persons present in court it could seem conspicuous that the juror, after having heard both the accused and the victim’s evidence, had not confined herself to informing about her previous contacts with A but had found it correct to add that she had experienced the victim as a “quiet and calm person”. The timing of J’s affirmation could easily have given the impression that J expressed a positive assessment of the victim.

Whilst a literal interpretation of “quiet and calm person” was not directly related to the credibility assessment, the affirmation was positively loaded and, when expressed just after the victim had given evidence, could at least easily have been perceived as if, according to J, one had to do with a person who would not make a fuss and thus would not make a false accusation about an attempt of rape. That J had expressed a view on how she had perceived her “at the time”, was of secondary importance. This was a nuance that could easily be overlooked by a person overhearing her statement and which, having regard to the timing, could hardly be perceived as a reservation with regard to A’s current character.

An important, albeit not decisive, consideration under section 108 of the Administration of Courts Act was also the fact that both counsel for the defence and the assistant advocate had demanded that J recuse herself. Under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, “the standpoint of the accused [was] important but not decisive”; in this case the “fear” of lack of impartiality by the applicant had been “objectively justified” (see Ferrantelli and Santangelo v. Italy, 7 August 1996, § 58, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996‑III).","{'applicant': 'Jørgen Kristiansen', 'articles': [91, 34, 54, 34, 44, 32, 34, 52, 49, 34, 93], 'countries': 'NOR', 'legal_branch': 'CHAMBER', 'year': 2015}",001-159211
